# Vitamin D (Calciferol)

## Overview
Vitamin D is a **fat-soluble, prohormone** that the human body can synthesise when the skin is exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. Unlike most vitamins, vitamin D functions more like a **steroid hormone** — it is activated in the kidneys and binds to nuclear receptors throughout the body, regulating thousands of genes. It exists in two main dietary forms:

- **Vitamin D2 (Ergocalciferol):** Synthesised by plants/fungi exposed to UV light
- **Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol):** Synthesised in human skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol; also from animal foods; generally more potent than D2 at raising serum 25(OH)D

Vitamin D deficiency is one of the most prevalent nutritional deficiencies globally, affecting an estimated 1 billion people.

## Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–12 months | 400 IU (10 mcg)/day (AI) |
| Children 1–13 years | 600 IU (15 mcg)/day |
| Adolescents 14–18 years | 600 IU (15 mcg)/day |
| Adults 19–70 years | 600 IU (15 mcg)/day |
| Adults >70 years | 800 IU (20 mcg)/day |
| Pregnant Women | 600 IU (15 mcg)/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 600 IU (15 mcg)/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 4,000 IU (100 mcg)/day for adults (conservative). Some non-government experts place the practical upper safe limit at 10,000 IU/day.

## Functions
- **Calcium & Phosphate Homeostasis:** Upregulates intestinal calcium absorption (via calbindin) and renal calcium reabsorption; stimulates osteoblast activity.
- **Bone Mineralisation:** Works with calcium and phosphate — essential for rickets prevention (children) and osteomalacia/osteoporosis prevention (adults).
- **Cell Growth & Differentiation:** Calcitriol inhibits proliferation and promotes differentiation of multiple cell types — anti-cancer activity mechanisms under investigation.
- **Immune Modulation:** Promotes innate immunity (macrophage and dendritic cell function); reduces excessive adaptive immune responses (autoimmune disease association).
- **Neuromuscular Function:** Required for muscle contraction and neuromuscular coordination; low levels associated with falls in elderly.
- **Insulin Secretion:** Supports pancreatic beta-cell function.
- **Cardiovascular:** Vitamin D receptors expressed in cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle; deficiency linked to hypertension and cardiomyopathy.
- **Gene Regulation:** Calcitriol (active form) binds vitamin D receptor (VDR) — a nuclear transcription factor regulating >200 genes.

## Cofactors Needed
Vitamin D requires several cofactors for activation and function:

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Magnesium** | Required by EVERY enzyme that metabolises vitamin D (CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1); deficiency impairs vitamin D activation |
| **Vitamin K2** | Directs calcium to bones and teeth; prevents calcium deposition in soft tissues/arteries; mitigates some risks of high-dose vitamin D |
| **Vitamin A** | Coordinates with VDR and RXR receptors for gene regulation; A and D work together |
| **Zinc** | Required for VDR (vitamin D receptor) synthesis |
| **Omega-3 fatty acids** | May enhance vitamin D efficacy, especially in individuals with liver/kidney dysfunction |

> **Important:** Supplementing vitamin D without ensuring adequate magnesium can be ineffective — magnesium is consumed in the hydroxylation steps.

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Skin Synthesis** | UVB (290–315 nm) converts 7-dehydrocholesterol → pre-D3 → cholecalciferol (D3) |
| **Absorption (dietary)** | Absorbed in the small intestine with dietary fat; incorporated into chylomicrons |
| **First hydroxylation (liver)** | D3 → 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] = "calcidiol" by CYP2R1/CYP27A1; **main circulating and measured form** |
| **Second hydroxylation (kidney)** | 25(OH)D → 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [calcitriol] by CYP27B1; **biologically active form** |
| **Calcitriol half-life** | 4–6 hours |
| **25(OH)D half-life** | 2–3 weeks (15–21 days) |
| **D3 half-life** | ~2 days |
| **Storage** | Adipose tissue (fat-soluble); can be released slowly over months |
| **Catabolism** | CYP24A1 inactivates calcitriol; regulated by PTH and blood calcium/phosphate |

## Effects of Deficiency
**Serum 25(OH)D status:**
- Deficient: <20 ng/mL (<50 nmol/L)
- Insufficient: 20–29 ng/mL
- Sufficient: ≥30 ng/mL

**Symptoms & Associated Conditions:**
- **Children:** Rickets — softening of bones, bowed legs, delayed dentition, muscle weakness, seizures (hypocalcaemia)
- **Adults:** Osteomalacia — diffuse bone pain, weakness, stress fractures; long-term → osteoporosis
- **Elderly:** Falls and fractures; muscle weakness; compromised immune function
- **Fatigue, depression**, chronic pain, frequent infections

**At-Risk Groups:**
- Dark-skinned individuals (melanin reduces UV-mediated D3 synthesis)
- Older adults (reduced skin synthesis; reduced renal activation)
- Those with limited sun exposure (office workers, northern latitudes, veiled women)
- Infants exclusively breastfed (breast milk low in vitamin D)
- Obese individuals (D3 sequestered in fat)
- Patients with fat malabsorption disorders
- Kidney or liver disease patients

## Treatment Protocols
| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Mild insufficiency (20–30 ng/mL) | 1,000–2,000 IU/day; dietary improvement + sun exposure |
| Deficiency (<20 ng/mL) | 2,000–4,000 IU/day × 8–12 weeks, then maintenance 1,500–2,000 IU/day |
| Severe deficiency (clinical) | Loading dose: 50,000 IU weekly × 8 weeks, then maintenance |
| Rickets (children) | High-dose vitamin D + calcium supplementation; specialist supervision |
| Hypoparathyroidism | Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) — bypasses renal hydroxylation step |
| Familial hypophosphatemia | Calcitriol or dihydrotachysterol under specialist supervision |

## Drug Interactions
| Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| Statins (atorvastatin) | Vitamin D may reduce statin levels via CYP3A4 induction |
| Thiazide diuretics | Increase the risk of hypercalcaemia when combined with vitamin D |
| Digoxin | Vitamin D enhances digoxin's effects on the heart |
| Aluminium antacids | Vitamin D increases aluminium absorption |
| Calcium channel blockers | Vitamin D enhances calcium absorption, potentially countering channel blockade |
| Anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine) | Accelerate vitamin D breakdown → deficiency risk |
| Corticosteroids (long-term) | Impair vitamin D activation and calcium absorption → osteoporosis risk |
| Orlistat | Reduces absorption of fat-soluble vitamins including D |

## Toxicity (Hypervitaminosis D)
Vitamin D toxicity results almost exclusively from **excessive supplementation**, NOT sun exposure (skin synthesis is self-regulating).

**Mechanism:** Excess calcitriol increases intestinal calcium absorption → **hypercalcaemia**

| Severity | Symptoms |
|---|---|
| Mild | Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, polyuria, polydipsia |
| Moderate | Constipation, muscle weakness, bone pain, confusion |
| Severe | Kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis, arrhythmias, kidney failure |

**Treatment:** Discontinue supplements; hydration; dietary calcium restriction; corticosteroids or bisphosphonates in severe cases.
