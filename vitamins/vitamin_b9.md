# Vitamin B9 (Folate / Folic Acid)

## Overview
Vitamin B9 is a water-soluble B vitamin that exists in two primary forms:
- **Folate:** Naturally occurring form in food; a family of compounds with different one-carbon substituents.
- **Folic Acid:** Synthetic oxidised form used in supplements and food fortification; more stable and more bioavailable (~85% vs ~50% for dietary folate).

Folate is critical for **DNA synthesis, cell division, and amino acid metabolism**. Its role in neural tube defect (NTD) prevention during early pregnancy is one of the most well-established nutritional findings in medicine.

Requirement is expressed in **Dietary Folate Equivalents (DFE)**:
- 1 mcg DFE = 1 mcg food folate = 0.6 mcg folic acid (supplement with food) = 0.5 mcg folic acid (supplement on empty stomach)

## Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 65 mcg DFE/day (AI) |
| Infants 7–12 months | 80 mcg DFE/day (AI) |
| Children 1–3 years | 150 mcg DFE/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 200 mcg DFE/day |
| Children 9–13 years | 300 mcg DFE/day |
| Adults (19+) | 400 mcg DFE/day |
| Pregnant Women | 600 mcg DFE/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 500 mcg DFE/day |
| Women planning pregnancy | 400–800 mcg folic acid/day (before conception) |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 1,000 mcg/day (as folic acid from supplements/fortified food) — higher doses can mask B12 deficiency.

## Functions
- **DNA & RNA Synthesis:** Folate coenzymes are one-carbon donors essential for purine and pyrimidine synthesis — the building blocks of DNA and RNA.
- **Cell Division:** Essential for rapidly dividing cells (bone marrow, GI epithelium, embryonic tissue).
- **Amino Acid Metabolism:** Converts homocysteine → methionine (1-carbon transfer via 5-MTHF and B12); serine ↔ glycine interconversion.
- **Erythropoiesis:** Required for maturation of red blood cells; deficiency causes megaloblastic anaemia.
- **Neural Tube Development:** Periconceptional folate reduces NTD risk (spina bifida, anencephaly) by 50–70%.
- **Methylation Reactions:** Methionine produced via folate-B12 metabolism is converted to SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) — the universal methyl donor for DNA methylation and gene regulation.
- **Cognitive Health:** Lower folate is associated with cognitive decline and depression in older adults.

## Cofactors Needed
Folate requires conversion to its active metabolic form by **dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)**:
- Folic acid → Dihydrofolate (DHF) → Tetrahydrofolate (THF) → 5,10-methyleneTHF → **5-methylTHF (5-MTHF)** [the main circulating form]

Key co-factors in folate metabolism:
| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Vitamin B12** | Required by methionine synthase to accept methyl group from 5-MTHF → regenerates THF |
| **Vitamin B6** | Metabolises homocysteine to cysteine (cystathionine pathway) |
| **NADPH** | Required by DHFR for folate reduction |
| **Zinc** | Supports DHFR activity |

> ⚠️ **Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR) genetic variants** (especially C677T) reduce conversion efficiency, increasing cardiovascular risk and NTD risk. Supplementation with 5-MTHF (pre-methylated form) bypasses this step.

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Dietary polyglutamate folates hydrolysed to monoglutamate in gut, then absorbed in jejunum; folic acid is better absorbed (~85% vs ~50%) |
| **Circulating Form** | 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) |
| **Plasma Half-Life** | ~1.5 hours (folic acid IM) |
| **RBC Folate Half-Life** | ~8 weeks |
| **Steady State (RBC)** | ~40 weeks |
| **Body Stores** | 15–30 mg total; ~50% in liver |
| **Excretion** | Urine; also bile and enterohepatic circulation |

---

## Effects of Deficiency
**Early Signs:**
- Megaloblastic anaemia: large, immature red blood cells; fatigue, pallor, weakness, dyspnoea
- Hypersegmented neutrophils on peripheral blood smear

**Advanced Signs:**
- Glossitis (sore, smooth tongue)
- Mouth ulcers
- GI disturbances
- Poor growth in children

**Pregnancy:**
- Neural tube defects (spina bifida, anencephaly)
- Placental abruption, miscarriage, low birth weight

**Neuropsychiatric (chronic):**
- Depression, cognitive impairment, dementia (overlapping with B12)

**At-Risk Groups:**
- Pregnant women
- Alcohol use disorder
- Patients with malabsorption disorders (celiac, Crohn's IBD)
- Those on methotrexate, anticonvulsants, or sulfasalazine
- MTHFR variant carriers

## Treatment Protocols
| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Dietary folate deficiency | 5 mg/day oral folic acid for ≥4 months |
| Megaloblastic anaemia (folate-related) | 5 mg/day oral; rule out and treat B12 deficiency FIRST |
| Neural tube defect prevention | 400–800 mcg folic acid/day before conception and through the first trimester |
| High-risk pregnancy (prior NTD) | 5 mg/day folic acid from pre-conception through week 12 |
| Methotrexate-induced folate depletion | 1–5 mg/day folic acid (not on methotrexate administration day) |

> ⚠️ **Critical:** Folic acid supplementation can mask vitamin B12 deficiency — always check and treat B12 status before or alongside folate treatment to prevent irreversible neurological damage.

## Drug Interactions
| Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| Methotrexate | Folate pathway antagonist — B9 can reduce side effects but may alter anti-cancer efficacy |
| Anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate, phenobarbital) | Reduce folate absorption; folic acid can lower their plasma levels and increase seizure risk |
| Pyrimethamine (antimalarial) | Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase |
| Sulfasalazine | Inhibits folate absorption |
| Proton pump inhibitors / H2 blockers | Reduce folate absorption over long-term use |
| Antacids (Al/Mg) | Impair folic acid absorption; separate by ≥2 hours |
| Zinc supplements | High-dose folic acid may reduce zinc absorption |
| Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole | Inhibits DHFR → functional folate deficiency |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Folate (mcg DFE) |
|---|---|---|
| Beef liver (cooked) | 85g | ~215 mcg |
| Spinach (cooked) | 90g | ~263 mcg |
| Black-eyed peas (cooked) | 180g | ~358 mcg |
| Asparagus (cooked) | 4 spears | ~89 mcg |
| Brussels sprouts (cooked) | 90g | ~78 mcg |
| Fortified breakfast cereal | 1 cup | 100–400 mcg |
| Orange (fresh) | 1 medium | ~48 mcg |
| Peanuts (dry roasted) | 28g | ~27 mcg |

> **Folate stability:** Very sensitive to heat, light, and oxygen. Prolonged cooking significantly reduces folate content. Eating raw or lightly-cooked vegetables preserves folate better.

---

## Storage & Stability
- Highly sensitive to heat — up to 50–90% can be lost through cooking
- Sensitive to UV light and oxygen
- Folic acid (synthetic) is more stable than naturally occurring food folates
- Store leafy vegetables in a dark, cool environment

---

## Toxicity
No known toxicity from folate in food. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 1,000 mcg/day applies specifically to **synthetic folic acid** due to concern about masking B12 neurological deficiency — not due to direct folate toxicity.
