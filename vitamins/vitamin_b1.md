# Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)

## Overview
Vitamin B1, also known as **thiamine**, is a water-soluble B-group vitamin essential for energy metabolism, neurological function, and muscle contraction. It was the first B vitamin to be discovered (isolated in 1926 by Jansen and Donath). The body stores only approximately 25–50 mg, primarily in the liver, heart, brain, and skeletal muscle — with a tissue half-life of only 9–18 days, making daily intake critical.

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** None established — no adverse effects from high oral intakes reported.

## Functions
- **Carbohydrate Metabolism:** Essential cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC) — the gateway enzyme converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA for the citric acid cycle.
- **Energy Production:** Cofactor for alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in the Krebs cycle.
- **Branched-Chain Amino Acid Metabolism:** Cofactor for branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase.
- **Pentose Phosphate Pathway:** Cofactor for transketolase — critical for nucleic acid synthesis and NADPH production.
- **Neural Signalling:** Involved in acetylcholine synthesis and nerve conduction.
- **Fatty Acid Synthesis:** Participates in mitochondrial energy and lipid biosynthesis pathways.

## Cofactors Needed
The active form of thiamine is **Thiamine Pyrophosphate (TPP)**, also called thiamine diphosphate. Its synthesis requires:

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Magnesium (Mg²⁺)** | Required cofactor for thiamine pyrophosphokinase (the enzyme that phosphorylates thiamine to TPP) |
| **ATP** | Donates phosphate groups to activate thiamine to TPP |

**Enzymes requiring TPP:**
1. Pyruvate dehydrogenase
2. Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
3. Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase
4. Transketolase
5. 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Active transport at physiological doses; passive diffusion at pharmacological doses; inhibited by alcohol |
| **Distribution** | Liver, heart, brain, kidneys, skeletal muscle |
| **Bioavailability** | 3.7–5.3% (thiamine hydrochloride); saturability limits high-dose oral benefit |
| **Tissue Half-Life** | 9–18 days |
| **Blood Half-Life** | 1–12 hours at high doses |
| **Metabolism** | Phosphorylated in the liver to TPP; excess excreted renally unchanged |
| **Excretion** | Primarily renal |

## Effects of Deficiency (Beriberi)
Thiamine deficiency is called **beriberi** (Sinhalese: "I cannot, I cannot") and presents in distinct clinical forms.

**Dry Beriberi (Neurological):**
- Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, burning in extremities)
- Muscle weakness, wasting, and pain
- Loss of deep tendon reflexes

**Wet Beriberi (Cardiovascular):**
- High-output heart failure
- Tachycardia, peripheral oedema, dyspnoea

**Wernicke Encephalopathy (acute):**
- Classic triad: ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, confusion
- Medical emergency; can progress to Korsakoff Syndrome (permanent memory impairment)

**Infantile Beriberi:**
- Occurs in breastfed infants of thiamine-deficient mothers
- Dyspnoea, cyanosis, vomiting, cardiac failure

**At-Risk Groups:**
- Chronic alcohol use disorder (impaired absorption + poor diet)
- Patients on dialysis
- Post-bariatric surgery patients
- Diets based heavily on white rice (polished)
- Prolonged high-dose diuretic use

**Lab Diagnosis:**
- Erythrocyte transketolase activity coefficient (ETK-AC) — gold standard
- Whole blood or serum thiamine levels

## Treatment Protocols
| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Mild deficiency | 10 mg/day oral for 1 week, then 3–5 mg/day for ≥6 weeks |
| Moderate clinical beriberi | 50–100 mg IM or IV followed by oral maintenance |
| Wernicke encephalopathy | 500 mg IV three times daily for 2–3 days, then 250 mg/day IV/IM for 3–5 days, then oral |
| Prophylaxis (alcoholics in hospital) | 100–200 mg IV before any glucose administration |

> **Critical Note:** Always administer thiamine BEFORE glucose/dextrose in at-risk patients — glucose infusion without thiamine can precipitate or worsen Wernicke encephalopathy.

## Drug Interactions
| Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| Alcohol (ethanol) | Inhibits intestinal thiamine transport and phosphorylation to TPP |
| Furosemide (loop diuretic) | Increases urinary thiamine excretion |
| Fluorouracil (5-FU) | Blocks thiamine phosphorylation |
| Patiromer | Binds oral thiamine; separate administration by ≥3 hours |
| Trimethoprim | May alter cellular thiamine uptake |
| Certain antibiotics (fleroxacin, fosfomycin) | May reduce thiamine via altered gut flora |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Thiamine (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Nutritional yeast | 1 tbsp | ~1.4 mg |
| Pork loin (cooked) | 85g | ~0.96 mg |
| Fortified breakfast cereal | 1 cup | 1.1–1.5 mg |
| Navy beans (cooked) | 180g | ~0.42 mg |
| Sunflower seeds | 28g | ~0.41 mg |
| Brown rice (cooked) | 195g | ~0.19 mg |
| Asparagus (cooked) | 180g | ~0.22 mg |
| Salmon (cooked) | 85g | ~0.26 mg |

> **Food processing note:** Milling/polishing of grains removes thiamine-rich bran and germ. White rice retains 10–30% of original thiamine vs. brown rice unless enriched.

## Storage & Stability
- **Heat-sensitive:** Cooking at high temperatures destroys significant thiamine (up to 50%).
- **Water-soluble:** Leaches into cooking water.
- **Alkaline-sensitive:** Destroyed rapidly in alkaline conditions (e.g., baking soda).
- **Raw fish/shellfish hazard:** Contain thiaminase enzymes that destroy thiamine; problem with diets high in raw fish.

## Toxicity
No known toxicity from dietary or supplemental thiamine by oral route. No UL established. At very high intravenous doses, rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported; IV administration should be done with caution.
