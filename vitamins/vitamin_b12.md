# Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)

## Overview
Vitamin B12, known as **cobalamin**, is the largest and most structurally complex of all vitamins. It contains a cobalt atom at its centre (giving it the "cobalt" in the name) within a corrin ring structure. It is unique among vitamins in that:
- It is **only found naturally in animal products** (synthesised by bacteria)
- It requires **intrinsic factor (IF)** for physiological absorption
- The body can store it for **3–5 years** in the liver
- It functions as a cofactor for just **two human enzymes**, but these are essential reactions

**Active coenzyme forms:**
- **Methylcobalamin** — functions in the cytoplasm (methionine synthase)
- **Adenosylcobalamin** — functions in the mitochondria (methylmalonyl-CoA mutase)

## Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 0.4 mcg/day (AI) |
| Infants 7–12 months | 0.5 mcg/day (AI) |
| Children 1–3 years | 0.9 mcg/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 1.2 mcg/day |
| Children 9–13 years | 1.8 mcg/day |
| Adolescents 14–18 years | 2.4 mcg/day |
| Adults (19+) | 2.4 mcg/day |
| Pregnant Women | 2.6 mcg/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 2.8 mcg/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** None established — no adverse effects reported from high intakes.

> **Special note for older adults (>50):** 10–30% cannot absorb B12 from food due to reduced gastric acid; should obtain B12 from supplements or fortified foods (crystalline B12 does not require IF for absorption at high doses).

## Functions
- **DNA Synthesis:** As methylcobalamin, activates folate cycle — essential for nucleotide synthesis and cell division.
- **Myelin Synthesis:** Critical for synthesis and maintenance of the myelin sheath around neurons; deficiency causes subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.
- **Red Blood Cell Maturation:** Works with folate in erythropoiesis; deficiency causes megaloblastic anaemia.
- **Homocysteine → Methionine Conversion:** Methionine synthase converts homocysteine to methionine — reducing cardiovascular risk and providing methyl groups via SAM (S-adenosylmethionine).
- **Methylmalonyl-CoA → Succinyl-CoA:** Adenosylcobalamin enables this mitochondrial conversion — vital for fatty acid and amino acid catabolism. Impaired reaction leads to methylmalonic aciduria (MMA).
- **Energy Metabolism:** Succinyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle.

## Cofactors Needed
B12 functions as a cofactor for two enzymes:

| Enzyme | Coenzyme Form | Reaction |
|---|---|---|
| **Methionine Synthase** | Methylcobalamin | Homocysteine + 5-MTHF → Methionine + THF |
| **Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase** | Adenosylcobalamin | L-methylmalonyl-CoA → Succinyl-CoA |

B12 metabolism also requires:
| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Folate (B9 / 5-MTHF)** | Provides the methyl group in the methionine synthase reaction |
| **Riboflavin (B2)** | MTHFR reaction (folate → 5-MTHF) |
| **Intrinsic Factor (IF)** | Glycoprotein from gastric parietal cells — essential for ileal absorption |
| **Transcobalamin II (TCII)** | Plasma transport protein for newly absorbed B12 |

---

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption (food-bound B12)** | Released by gastric acid and pepsin; binds R-proteins then intrinsic factor; absorbed in distal ileum |
| **Absorption (crystalline B12)** | ~1–3% absorbed passively (without IF) at high supplemental doses |
| **Peak Plasma (IM injection)** | Within 1 hour |
| **Plasma Half-Life** | ~6 days |
| **Body Stores** | 2–5 mg total; 50–90% stored in liver |
| **Hepatic Storage** | Years (3–5 years supply) |
| **Excretion** | Bile (enterohepatic recycling); urine (excess, especially after IM) |
| **IM half-life (cyanocobalamin)** | 20–50 minutes; 50–90% excreted in urine within 48h |
| **Hydroxocobalamin** | Retained longer than cyanocobalamin |

## Effects of Deficiency
**Pathophysiology:** Deficiency impairs both methylcobalamin-dependent and adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzymes:
- Homocysteine accumulates (cardiovascular risk)
- Methylmalonic acid accumulates (neurotoxic)
- Folate becomes trapped as 5-MTHF ("folate trap") → functional folate deficiency

**Early Symptoms:**
- Fatigue, weakness
- Pale or yellowish skin
- Palpitations, shortness of breath (anaemia)

**Haematological:**
- Megaloblastic/macrocytic anaemia
- Hypersegmented neutrophils

**Neurological (Subacute Combined Degeneration — SCD):**
- Progressive demyelination of dorsal and lateral spinal columns
- Paraesthesia, proprioception loss → ataxia → spastic paraparesis
- Cognitive decline, memory impairment, depression
- **Can be irreversible if untreated**

**At-Risk Groups:**
- Vegans and strict vegetarians
- Elderly (reduced IF and gastric acid)
- Gastric bypass / gastrectomy patients
- Pernicious anaemia (autoimmune destruction of parietal cells → no IF)
- Long-term metformin and PPI users
- Patients with ileal resection/Crohn's disease

**Lab Diagnosis:**
- Serum B12 <200 pg/mL = probable deficiency
- Elevated serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) — most sensitive functional marker
- Elevated homocysteine (non-specific)
- Schilling test (rarely used now)

## Treatment Protocols
| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Dietary deficiency (normal absorption) | 1,000–2,000 mcg/day oral cyanocobalamin or methylcobalamin |
| Malabsorption (no IF) | Hydroxocobalamin 1 mg IM on alternate days × 2 weeks, then monthly lifelong |
| Pernicious anaemia (UK protocol) | Hydroxocobalamin 1 mg IM, 3× weekly × 2 weeks; then every 2–3 months lifelong |
| Neurological deficiency | Hydroxocobalamin IM alternate days until no further improvement, then every 2 months |
| Vegan / vegetarian prophylaxis | 250–500 mcg/day oral supplementation or fortified foods |

> ⚠️ **Never treat folate-deficiency anaemia with folic acid alone** without ruling out B12 deficiency — doing so corrects the blood picture but allows neurological deterioration to continue.

## Drug Interactions
| Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, etc.) | Reduce gastric acid → impair B12 liberation from food |
| H2 blockers (ranitidine, famotidine) | Same mechanism as PPIs |
| Metformin | Reduces B12 absorption (mechanism involves calcium-dependent transport) |
| Cholestyramine | Reduces absorption by binding cobalamins |
| Colchicine | Interferes with B12 absorption |
| Aminosalicylic acid | Impairs B12 absorption |
| Alcohol (chronic) | Reduces B12 absorption and storage |
| Chloramphenicol | Inhibits erythrocyte B12 uptake |

## Storage & Stability
- Relatively stable during cooking when heated
- Sensitive to strong alkali and strong acid
- Also sensitive to UV light
- Stored well in the body — deficiency takes years to develop from dietary insufficiency alone
