# Cysteine

## Overview
Cysteine is a **conditionally essential amino acid** — it can be synthesised from **methionine** via the **transsulphuration pathway** (with adequate B6, folate, B12), but becomes essential when methionine intake is insufficient or in premature infants, individuals with liver disease, and critically ill patients. Cysteine is the rate-limiting precursor of **glutathione (GSH)** — the body's primary antioxidant tripeptide — and is a key component of proteins requiring structural disulphide bonds. Its thiol (–SH) group is highly reactive and participates in redox chemistry, metal binding, and enzyme catalysis.

- **Classification:** Conditionally essential
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Cys / C
- **Side chain:** Thiol (–CH₂–SH); pKa ~8.3; the most nucleophilic and oxidation-sensitive side chain
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Glucogenic (→ pyruvate)

## Dietary Requirements

| Age / Group | Notes |
|---|---|
| Adults | Can be synthesised from methionine; RDA expressed as combined Met + Cys (~19 mg/kg/day) |
| Preterm infants | Essential — limited transsulphuration capacity → must be provided in formula |
| Liver disease / critically ill | Hepatic transsulphuration impaired → dietary cysteine becomes essential |

> No established UL for food cysteine. Cysteine is unstable in solution (oxidises to cystine); parenteral nutrition formulas use N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to deliver cysteine.

## Functions

- **Glutathione (GSH) Synthesis:** Cys is the rate-limiting precursor of GSH (γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine). GSH is the cell's major antioxidant, detoxification agent (Phase II conjugation), and redox buffer. GSH levels critically depend on cysteine availability.
- **Disulfide Bond Formation:** Cys residues in proteins form **S–S bonds** (oxidation; creating cystine) — essential for extracellular protein structure (immunoglobulins, albumin, elastin, insulin, keratin, receptor ligand-binding domains)
- **Taurine Synthesis:** Cys → cysteine sulphinic acid → hypotaurine → **taurine** (requires B6) — taurine is a conditionally essential compound critical in bile acid conjugation, cardiac function, vision (retinal), and neurological development (especially in infants)
- **Coenzyme A (CoA) Synthesis:** Pantothenic acid (B5) + cysteine → CoA — Cys sidechain provides the crucial thiol of CoA's active site
- **Enzyme Catalysis:** Cys is the active-site nucleophile in cysteine proteases (papain, calpain, caspases, cathepsins) and in many other thiol-catalysed enzymes
- **Metal Binding/Sensing:** Cys thiol groups coordinate Fe, Zn, Cu in metalloenzymes and metal-responsive transcription factors (e.g., MTF-1 responds to zinc via cys-containing zinc fingers)
- **Redox Signalling:** Reversible oxidation of protein cys thiols (to sulfenic acid, disulphide, glutathionylation) — key mechanism in redox-regulated signalling and oxidative stress sensing
- **Ferroptosis Regulation:** Cysteine (via system Xc⁻ glutamate/cystine antiporter) feeds GSH synthesis, which via GPx4 prevents lipid peroxidation — blockage of system Xc⁻ induces ferroptosis (cell death by lipid peroxidation)
- **Keratin and Hair/Nail Structure:** ~10–14% of keratin is cysteine — intermolecular disulphide bonds give hair strength and curling (chemical perms break these bonds)

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Synthesis** | Homocysteine + Serine → Cystathionine (CBS; B6) → Cysteine + α-ketobutyrate (CTH; B6) |
| **GSH synthesis** | Glu + Cys → γ-Glu-Cys (GCL; rate-limiting; inhibited by BSO) + Gly → GSH (GSS) |
| **Taurine** | Cys → cysteine sulphinic acid → taurine (CSADase; B6 cofactor) |
| **Catabolism** | Cys → pyruvate (glucogenic); also cys → H₂S (gasotransmitter) via CBS, CSE, MST enzymes |
| **H₂S production** | Cysteine → hydrogen sulphide (H₂S) — a gaseous signalling molecule; vasodilator, neuroprotectant |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Cysteine (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Chicken breast (cooked) | 85g | ~350 mg |
| Beef (lean, cooked) | 85g | ~330 mg |
| Egg | 1 large | ~150 mg |
| Sunflower seeds | 28g | ~230 mg |
| Oats (dry) | 40g | ~155 mg |
| Ricotta cheese | 120g | ~180 mg |
| Brazil nuts | 28g | ~140 mg |
| Lentils (cooked) | 200g | ~230 mg |

> N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) and whey protein are common supplemental sources of cysteine.

## Clinical Relevance

### Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) Overdose
- Paracetamol → NAPQI (toxic reactive metabolite via CYP2E1/CYP3A4)
- NAPQI depletes hepatic glutathione → hepatocellular necrosis
- **N-acetylcysteine (NAC) IV/oral** is the antidote: replenishes cysteine → GSH → detoxifies remaining NAPQI
- NAC must be given within 8–16 hours of ingestion for maximum efficacy

### Cystinuria
- Defect in the **rBAT-SLC7A9** dibasic amino acid transporter (also affects arginine, ornithine, lysine)
- Cystine (oxidised dimer of cysteine) is insoluble in urine → **cystine kidney stones** (recurrent, staghorn calculi)
- Treatment: high fluid intake (>3 L/day), urine alkalinisation (cystine more soluble at pH >7), D-penicillamine or tiopronin (form soluble complexes with cystine), dietary sodium and animal protein restriction

### Cystinosis
- Lysosomal cystine transporter (cystinosin) defect → cystine crystal accumulation in lysosomes of all tissues
- Most common cause of inherited Fanconi syndrome in children; progresses to chronic kidney disease
- Treatment: **cysteamine** (reacts with intralysosomal cystine → mixed disulphide that can exit lysosomes); renal replacement therapy; transplant

### Homocystinuria (Overlap with Methionine note)
- CBS deficiency → impaired Hcy → cystathionine → cysteine → secondary cysteine deficiency
- Treated partly with cystine supplementation to compensate for inability to synthesise cysteine

### COPD / Pulmonary Mucus
- NAC (600–1,200 mg/day) reduces mucus viscosity by breaking disulphide bonds in mucin glycoproteins → mucolytic; used in COPD and cystic fibrosis

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Methionine** | Upstream precursor (transsulphuration) — cysteine can spare methionine requirements |
| **Vitamin B6** | Required for CBS and CTH (both transsulphuration enzymes); deficiency impairs cysteine synthesis |
| **Folate + B12** | Regulate homocysteine → methionine flux; deficiency pushes Hcy toward transsulphuration, increasing cysteine but also increasing demands on CBS |
| **Selenium** | Selenocysteine biosynthesis uses serine + selenophosphate analogously to cysteine biosynthesis |
| **Copper** | Excess copper oxidises cysteine thiols → may reduce enzyme thiol function; GSH chelates copper |
| **NAC + nitroglycerin** | NAC co-administration with nitroglycerin reduces nitrate tolerance; clinically relevant in chest pain management |
| **BSO (buthionine sulfoximine)** | Research tool — inhibits GCL → depletes GSH by blocking cysteine incorporation |

## Supplementation Notes
- **NAC (N-Acetylcysteine, 600–2,400 mg/day):**
  - Mucolytic (COPD, CF, bronchitis)
  - Antidote for paracetamol overdose (IV protocol)
  - Antioxidant / GSH precursor
  - Used in psychiatric research (OCD, schizophrenia, addiction — oxredox hypothesis)
  - Modest evidence for reducing contrast-induced nephropathy (pretreatment)
- **Whey protein:** Rich in cysteine + branched-chain amino acids — effectively raises GSH levels in ageing adults
- **Cystine (oxidised dimer):** Poorly soluble; not effective as a supplement
- High-dose cysteine alone (unchelated) can be pro-oxidant at very high concentrations — NAC form is preferred for supplementation
