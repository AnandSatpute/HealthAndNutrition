# Glutamine

## Overview
Glutamine is the **most abundant free amino acid** in the human body (plasma concentration ~500–900 μmol/L; ~60% of the free amino acid pool in muscle). It is classified as **conditionally essential** — synthesised de novo from glutamate + ammonia (via glutamine synthetase), but demand exceeds synthesis capacity during catabolic states (surgery, trauma, burns, sepsis, prolonged exercise). Glutamine is a critical fuel for **rapidly proliferating cells** (enterocytes, lymphocytes) and is the principal vehicle for **inter-organ nitrogen transport** and **ammoniagenesis** in the kidney during acidosis.

- **Classification:** Conditionally essential
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Gln / Q
- **Side chain:** Amide group (–CONH₂); polar, uncharged at physiological pH
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Glucogenic (→ α-ketoglutarate → TCA cycle; or → glucose via gluconeogenesis)

## Dietary Requirements

| Condition | Notes |
|---|---|
| Healthy adults | Synthesised endogenously; no established RDA; ~3–6 g/day from dietary proteins |
| Critical illness / trauma | Conditionally essential; supplemental doses of 20–40 g/day studied |
| Athletes (intense training) | Plasma Gln falls after prolonged endurance exercise → increased demand |

> No established UL. High-dose glutamine (>40 g/day) in critically ill patients without monitoring has been associated with adverse outcomes in some trials (REDOXS trial, AKI/MI context).

## Functions

- **Primary Fuel for Enterocytes:** Small intestinal enterocytes preferentially oxidise glutamine (not glucose) for energy — via glutaminolysis (Gln → Glu → α-KG → TCA). Critical for mucosal integrity, villus structure, and gut barrier function.
- **Lymphocyte & Macrophage Fuel:** Rapidly dividing immune cells rely heavily on glutamine as an oxidative and biosynthetic fuel — immune function declines in glutamine-depleted states (major surgery, critical illness)
- **Nitrogen Shuttle (Inter-Organ Nitrogen Transport):**
  - Muscle releases glutamine (from glutamate + NH₄⁺ via glutamine synthetase) → liver and kidney take up glutamine
  - Liver: Gln → glutamate → urea cycle (ammonia disposal) / gluconeogenesis
  - Kidney: Gln → NH₄⁺ + glutamate → α-KG (renal ammoniagenesis; excretes acid during acidosis)
- **Ammonia Homeostasis:** Glutamine synthetase in astrocytes detoxifies NH₃ → Gln (critical in liver failure/hepatic encephalopathy — cerebral Gln accumulates → astrocyte dysfunction)
- **Nucleotide Synthesis:** Gln donates its amide nitrogen in purine and pyrimidine ring biosynthesis — essential for DNA/RNA synthesis in all dividing cells
- **Gluconeogenesis Substrate:** Major precursor for hepatic glucose production during fasting; muscle-derived glutamine → renal/hepatic gluconeogenesis
- **Acid-Base Balance:** Renal glutamine uptake → NH₄⁺ excretion in urine → net acid excretion → alkalinises blood during metabolic acidosis
- **GSH Synthesis Substrate:** Gln → Glu → one of three GSH precursors (with cysteine and glycine)
- **mTORC1 Activation (indirect):** Glutamine is required for leucine-induced mTORC1 activation via the SLC38A9/Ragulator/v-ATPase sensing system; glutamine also activates mTORC1 through GATOR2/FLCN pathway
- **Neurotransmitter Cycle:** Astrocytes convert synaptically released glutamate → Gln (via glutamine synthetase) → shuttle Gln to neurons → neurons release Glu (glutamate) or GABA; disruption of the glutamine-glutamate cycle is implicated in epilepsy and hepatic encephalopathy

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Synthesis** | Glutamate + NH₄⁺ + ATP → Glutamine (glutamine synthetase; GS; ubiquitous, especially muscle + astrocytes) |
| **Catabolism** | Gln → Glu + NH₄⁺ (glutaminase; kidney, liver, lymphocytes, enterocytes) |
| **TCA entry** | Glu → α-ketoglutarate (GDH or transaminases) → Krebs cycle |
| **Gluconeogenesis** | Gln → Glu → α-KG → OAA → PEP → Glucose |
| **Nucleotide synthesis** | Gln amide N donates to PRPP → purine synthesis; to UMP → pyrimidine synthesis |
| **Renal ammoniagenesis** | Kidney glutaminase → NH₄⁺ (excreted) + Glu → α-KG → glucose |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Glutamine (mg, approx.) |
|---|---|---|
| Beef (lean, cooked) | 85g | ~1,200 mg |
| Chicken (cooked) | 85g | ~1,100 mg |
| Fish (cooked) | 85g | ~900–1,000 mg |
| Eggs | 1 large | ~300 mg |
| Milk (whole) | 240 mL | ~320 mg |
| Tofu (firm) | 100g | ~550 mg |
| Cabbage (raw) | 90g | ~170 mg |
| Wheat germ | 28g | ~340 mg |

> Glutamine is labile — easily destroyed by heat and prolonged cooking. High-heat processing of protein foods significantly reduces free glutamine content.

## Clinical Relevance

### Critical Illness and ICU Nutrition
- Plasma glutamine falls dramatically after major surgery, burns, trauma, sepsis → "glutamine debt"
- Glutamine supplementation in parenteral nutrition (PN): 0.3–0.5 g/kg/day (usually as glutamine dipeptide alanine-glutamine or glycine-glutamine for stability)
- **REDOXS Trial (2013):** High-dose IV + enteral glutamine supplementation in MICU patients with multi-organ failure → **increased 28-day mortality** and AKI in sickest patients (MOF, AKI at baseline) — suggests glutamine supplementation is harmful in severe MOF
- Current ESPEN guidelines: glutamine supplementation may be beneficial in burns and elective surgery; **avoid in unstable MOF/AKI**
- Benefit confirmed in parenteral nutrition patients (reduces infections, hospital LOS in stable critically ill)

### Gut Integrity and Short Bowel Syndrome
- Short bowel syndrome (SBS): massively reduced absorptive surface → enterocyte glutamine deficiency → mucosal atrophy
- Glutamine supplementation (30 g/day) as part of bowel rehabilitation protocols; often combined with growth hormone and modified diet (the Byrne-Wilmore protocol)

### Hepatic Encephalopathy
- In liver failure, glutamine accumulates in astrocytes (liver cannot clear NH₄⁺ → peripherally converted to Gln via GS)
- Cerebral oedema and astrocyte swelling → HE symptoms
- Paradox: glutamine synthesis normally detoxifies ammonia (protective), but glutamine itself accumulates and is re-metabolised in mitochondria (glutaminase) → releases NH₃ intramitochondrially → oxidative stress ("Trojan horse" hypothesis)

### Cancer Metabolism
- Many cancers are **glutamine-addicted** — rely on glutaminolysis to fuel TCA/anaplerosis, nucleotide synthesis, GSH, and reductive carboxylation for lipid synthesis in hypoxia
- Glutaminase inhibitors (CB-839, telaglenastat) in clinical trials for solid tumours
- The concept of "glutamine depletion" therapy — reduce tumour fuel supply

### Sickle Cell Anaemia
- **Endari (L-glutamine oral powder, 10 g twice daily):** FDA-approved for adults and paediatric patients ≥5 years with sickle cell disease
- Mechanism: Gln → NAD⁺ synthesis → reduces oxidative stress in sickle RBCs → fewer vaso-occlusive crises
- Reduces hospitalisation frequency by ~25%

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Leucine (mTORC1)** | Glutamine is required for leucine-induced mTORC1 activation; glutamine depletion blunts mTOR signalling even with leucine |
| **Cysteine + Glycine** | All three are GSH precursors — glutamine→glutamate feeds GSH first peptide step |
| **Methotrexate / Azathioprine** | Inhibit nucleotide synthesis (purine/pyrimidine) — pathways that require glutamine as N-donor; glutamine availability affects efficacy/toxicity |
| **Glucocorticoids** | Increase muscle glutamine release and whole-body glutamine flux; chronic use → muscle glutamine depletion and wasting |
| **Ammonia** | Glutamine synthesis removes NH₃; glutaminase releases NH₃ — the two reactions must be balanced; GS inhibitors (e.g., MSO) raise ammonia |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Powder form (5–15 g/day):** Used by athletes post-exercise to replenish plasma glutamine; evidence for immune benefit is modest in recreational athletes; more relevant in intense military training or ultra-endurance athletes
- **Bowel disease:** Some use in IBD/IBS for mucosal support; evidence is limited (Crohn's trials negative; some benefit in IBS-D at 5 g three times daily)
- **Cancer patients on chemotherapy:** QoL support; some protocols include 10–30 g/day to reduce mucositis — mixed evidence; not standard of care
- **Stability:** Free L-glutamine powder is stable at room temperature but degrades in solution over time; alanyl-glutamine dipeptide is more stable for parenteral/enteral use
- **Caution:** Do not supplement at high doses (>40 g/day) in patients with AKI, MOF, or hepatic encephalopathy
