# Tryptophan

## Overview
Tryptophan is an **essential amino acid** with the largest and most structurally complex aromatic side chain of any standard amino acid. It is the sole precursor of **serotonin** (5-HT), **melatonin**, and **niacin (vitamin B3)** in humans. Despite being the least abundant essential amino acid in most dietary proteins, it plays an outsized role in mood regulation, sleep, immune function, and cellular energy metabolism. Its metabolism branches into three major pathways: the **kynurenine pathway** (~95%), **serotonin/melatonin pathway** (~1–2%), and direct protein incorporation.

- **Classification:** Essential (9 essential amino acids)
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Trp / W
- **Side chain:** Indole ring (benzene + pyrrole fused); most hydrophobic and bulky aromatic side chain
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Both (→ acetoacetyl-CoA \[ketogenic\]; TCA intermediates via kynurenine pathway \[glucogenic\])

## Dietary Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA (mg/kg/day) | Approximate daily need |
|---|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | ~17 mg/kg/day | — |
| Children 1–3 years | ~12 mg/kg/day | ~266 mg/day |
| Adults 19+ | ~5 mg/kg/day | ~350 mg/day (70 kg adult) |

> Lowest absolute requirement of the essential amino acids. No established UL from food. Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) in 1989 was linked to a contaminated L-tryptophan batch, not tryptophan itself.

## Functions

### Serotonin / Melatonin Pathway (~1–2% of Trp)
- Trp → **5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)** (tryptophan hydroxylase; requires BH4, Fe²⁺, O₂) → **Serotonin (5-HT)** (aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase; requires B6)
- Serotonin → **N-acetylserotonin** → **Melatonin** (AANAT + ASMT enzymes; in pineal gland, regulated by darkness)
- Serotonin functions: mood, appetite, gut motility (90% of 5-HT is in enterochromaffin cells), platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction, sexual function, sleep
- Melatonin: circadian rhythm regulation, antioxidant, immune modulation

### Kynurenine Pathway (~95% of Trp catabolism)
- Trp → **Kynurenine** (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, IDO — major; or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, TDO — liver-specific)
- Kynurenine branches:
  - → **Kynurenic acid** (KYNA): NMDA receptor antagonist, neuroprotective (B6-dependent)
  - → **Quinolinic acid** (QUIN): NMDA agonist, excitotoxic, pro-inflammatory; neurotoxic at high levels
  - → **Nicotinamide / NAD⁺:** ~60 mg Trp → ~1 mg niacin (very inefficient; requires thiamine, B2, B6, iron)
  - → **Picolinic acid:** Zinc chelator; modulates immune function
- IDO is upregulated by interferons and inflammation — the body diverts Trp away from serotonin synthesis during infection/inflammation (mechanism of infection-related depression and fatigue)

### Niacin Synthesis
- Trp is the only endogenous source of niacin — though conversion is inefficient (60:1 ratio by weight)
- Protein-replete individuals can generate some niacin from Trp; pellagra occurs when both niacin and Trp are deficient (corn- and sorghum-dominant diets)

### Immune Regulation (IDO-mediated)
- IDO in antigen-presenting cells depletes local Trp → starves T cells → immune tolerance
- Critical in: tumour immune evasion, maternal tolerance of fetus, transplant tolerance
- IDO inhibitors are in clinical trials as cancer immunotherapy adjuncts

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Active transport via LAT1 (SLC7A5) and B0AT1 (SLC6A19); competes with other large neutral amino acids |
| **Blood-brain barrier** | Transported by LAT1 — BCAAs reduce Trp brain uptake (competitive transport) |
| **Hydroxylation** | Tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (TPH1, periphery/gut) and TPH2 (brain) — rate-limiting for serotonin synthesis; requires BH4 |
| **Kynurenine pathway** | IDO (widespread, inducible by IFN-γ) and TDO (liver, inducible by Trp itself and glucocorticoids) |
| **Half-life (plasma Trp)** | Relatively short; ~1–2 hours; plasma Trp is mostly albumin-bound (~80–90%) |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Tryptophan (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Turkey (roasted) | 85g | ~250 mg |
| Chicken breast (cooked) | 85g | ~240 mg |
| Tuna (canned) | 85g | ~290 mg |
| Milk (whole) | 240 mL | ~110 mg |
| Greek yoghurt | 170g | ~115 mg |
| Egg | 1 large | ~75 mg |
| Pumpkin seeds | 28g | ~170 mg |
| Tofu (firm) | 100g | ~130 mg |
| Chocolate (dark, 70%) | 28g | ~65 mg |

> The "turkey makes you sleepy" myth — turkey Trp is similar to other meats; the effect is more related to large carbohydrate meals (insulin lowers competing amino acids → relative Trp advantage at BBB).

## Clinical Relevance

### Carcinoid Syndrome
- Neuroendocrine tumours (carcinoid) produce large amounts of serotonin from Trp — up to 70% of Trp is diverted
- Results in niacin deficiency (pellagra-like) due to Trp diversion away from NAD⁺ synthesis
- Features: flushing, diarrhoea, bronchospasm, right heart valve disease

### Depression and the Serotonin Hypothesis
- Tryptophan depletion (acute dietary Trp lowering) causes temporary depressive symptoms in recovered depressed individuals — evidence for the serotonin-Trp-mood link
- SSRIs work downstream of Trp (block 5-HT reuptake) — Trp availability is the upstream precursor constraint
- Dietary Trp alone does not reliably improve depression in unselected individuals

### Pellagra and Niacin
- Classic pellagra from corn-dominant diets (niacin in corn is bound, unavailable; corn is also Trp-poor)
- Treated with nicotinamide/niacin supplementation
- Occurs in Hartnup disease (Trp absorption disorder — see below)

### Hartnup Disease
- Defect in SLC6A19 (B0AT1) — impaired intestinal and renal absorption of neutral amino acids including tryptophan
- Features: pellagra-like rash (photosensitive), cerebellar ataxia, psychiatric symptoms (intermittent)
- Treatment: high-protein diet + nicotinamide supplementation

### IDO and Cancer / Inflammation
- IDO-high tumours deplete local Trp → suppress tumour-infiltrating T cells → immune evasion
- IDO inhibitors (epacadostat) in clinical trials for cancer immunotherapy; most have failed as monotherapy but combinations continue
- Chronic inflammation → high IDO → Trp→Kynurenine shift → reduced serotonin, increased QUIN (neurotoxic) — proposed mechanism for depression in inflammatory diseases

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **BCAAs (Leu, Ile, Val)** | Compete with Trp at LAT1 for BBB entry — high BCAA intake reduces brain serotonin synthesis |
| **Carbohydrates** | Insulin release lowers plasma BCAAs → relatively increases Trp brain ratio → increased 5-HT synthesis (post-meal effect) |
| **Vitamin B6 (PLP)** | Cofactor for 5-HTP → serotonin decarboxylation AND for kynurenine → kynurenic acid (KYAT) pathway |
| **Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)** | Cofactor for tryptophan hydroxylase — deficiency reduces 5-HT synthesis |
| **SSRIs** | Act downstream; patient response may be affected by baseline Trp availability |
| **MAOIs** | Block serotonin degradation (MAO-A); combining with high Trp or 5-HTP risks serotonin syndrome |
| **5-HTP supplements** | Direct precursor to serotonin; bypasses tryptophan hydroxylase; should not be combined with MAOIs or SSRIs without medical supervision |

## Supplementation Notes
- **L-Tryptophan (500 mg – 2 g/day):** Used for sleep, mild depression, premenstrual dysphoria; limited but positive evidence
- **5-HTP (50–300 mg/day):** More readily crosses BBB and enters serotonin synthesis; better-studied than L-Trp for mood/sleep; don't combine with MAOIs/SSRIs (serotonin syndrome risk)
- **Melatonin:** Downstream product of Trp; 0.5–5 mg for sleep onset; shorter-acting than L-Trp supplementation
- Take Trp or 5-HTP with carbohydrates for best brain uptake (reduces competing amino acids)
