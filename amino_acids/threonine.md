# Threonine

## Overview
Threonine is an **essential amino acid** with a hydroxyl group on its side chain, making it a target for common post-translational modifications. It is one of the three hydroxyl-containing amino acids (alongside serine and tyrosine). Threonine is critical for **mucin glycoprotein synthesis** (intestinal mucosal barrier), **collagen and elastin** structure, and serves as a precursor for **glycine** and **succinyl-CoA**. It is the second most limiting amino acid in human diets after lysine in plant-protein–based diets.

- **Classification:** Essential (9 essential amino acids)
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Thr / T
- **Side chain:** β-hydroxy group (–CHOH–CH₃); has two stereocentres; hydroxyl participates in H-bonding, phosphorylation, O-glycosylation
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Both (→ glycine + acetyl-CoA \[ketogenic\]; → succinyl-CoA \[glucogenic\])

## Dietary Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA (mg/kg/day) | Approximate daily need |
|---|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | ~73 mg/kg/day | — |
| Children 1–3 years | ~33 mg/kg/day | ~730 mg/day |
| Adults 19+ | ~15 mg/kg/day | ~1,050 mg/day (70 kg adult) |

> No established UL for threonine from food. IV threonine infusions at very high doses have caused motor dysfunction in animal models.

## Functions

- **Mucin & Glycoprotein Synthesis:** Threonine is the most abundant amino acid in mucin-core proteins (MUC2, MUC5B, MUC5AC) — its hydroxyl group is the site of O-linked glycan attachment that gives mucins their gel-like properties. Critical for intestinal mucosal barrier integrity and respiratory tract protection.
- **Collagen & Connective Tissue:** Threonine is incorporated into collagen and elastin where it contributes hydrogen bonds and β-sheet structures in fibrous proteins.
- **Glycine Precursor:** Threonine → glycine (via threonine aldolase) + acetaldehyde; provides ~10–20% of glycine requirements.
- **Immune Function:** Threonine depletion impairs T-cell proliferation and immunoglobulin synthesis; first-pass intestinal mucosal uptake is very high (gut uses ~50–70% of dietary threonine before systemic delivery).
- **Central Nervous System:** Glycine, derived from threonine, is an inhibitory neurotransmitter; levels of threonine affect CNS inhibitory tone. High threonine intake → increased spinal cord glycine levels (used in clinical trials for spasticity).
- **Post-Translational Modifications:**
  - **Phosphorylation** (by serine/threonine kinases — e.g., PKA, PKC, AKT): Regulates enzyme/protein activity throughout cell signalling
  - **O-glycosylation** (O-GlcNAcylation): Links cell metabolism (UDP-GlcNAc from glucose) to protein activity; competes with phosphorylation at the same residues
- **Liver Function:** Required for synthesis of fibronectin and plasma proteins; moderate deficiency → hepatic steatosis in animal models.

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Active transport (SLC6A19/B0AT1; SLC1A5/ASCT2) in small intestine |
| **First-pass gut utilisation** | Very high — intestinal epithelium and microbiome consume majority of dietary threonine |
| **Catabolism (main)** | Thr → 2-oxobutyrate → propionyl-CoA → succinyl-CoA (glucogenic) |
| **Alternative pathway** | Thr → glycine + acetaldehyde (threonine aldolase); acetaldehyde → acetyl-CoA (ketogenic) |
| **Serine-glycine interplay** | Shares one-carbon metabolism with serine and glycine in the folate cycle |

## Clinical Relevance

### Mucosal Barrier and Gut Health
- Intestinal threonine utilisation is extremely high — up to 70% of absorbed threonine goes to gut epithelium
- Dietary threonine deficiency → reduced mucin synthesis → impaired mucosal barrier → increased intestinal permeability
- Relevant in: critical illness, inflammatory bowel disease, neonatal gut development, premature infants

### Threonine and Spasticity
- Intrathecal glycine has well-established muscle-relaxant / antispastic properties
- Oral L-threonine (4.5–6 g/day) increases CSF glycine → some studies show modest reduction in spasticity in multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury patients
- Evidence is limited; not a first-line treatment

### Inborn Errors (Rare)
- Isolated threonine catabolism defects are extremely rare; propionyl-CoA downstream defects (propionic acidaemia, methylmalonic acidaemia) affect the glucogenic arm of threonine catabolism

### Protein Quality Assessment
- Threonine is the **second most limiting essential amino acid** in wheat-based diets (after lysine)
- The DIAAS (Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score) uses threonine as a reference amino acid for food quality comparative scoring

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Glycine** | Threonine is a dietary precursor of glycine; glycine availability depends partly on threonine intake |
| **Folate cycle** | Glycine interconverts with serine in the folate one-carbon cycle — threonine→glycine feeds into this |
| **Intestinal microbiome** | Gut bacteria utilise threonine as carbon/nitrogen source; large intestinal fermentation produces threonine-derived metabolites |
| **Mucin synthesis** | Adequate threonine is particularly critical in neonates and ICU patients requiring enteral nutrition — commercially formulated feeds account for intestinal extraction |

## Supplementation Notes
- Rarely supplemented in isolation in healthy adults
- Used in clinical research for **spasticity** (high-dose oral L-Thr to raise CSF glycine) — not standard of care
- Important in **infant formula and neonatal parenteral nutrition** design — high gut extraction means formulas need more threonine than systemic requirement models would predict
- Plant-based diets combining cereals (threonine-limited) with legumes (threonine-adequate) generally meet requirements
