# Glycine

## Overview
Glycine is the **simplest amino acid** — it is the only amino acid without a chiral centre, with a hydrogen atom as its side chain. It is classified as **conditionally essential**: synthesised from serine (primarily), threonine, and choline, but endogenous synthesis (~3 g/day) is insufficient to meet total body demands, especially for collagen synthesis (estimated need ~10–14 g/day). Glycine is the most abundant amino acid in **collagen** (~33% of all collagen residues), a key inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brainstem and spinal cord, and a primary conjugate for bile acid and xenobiotic detoxification.

- **Classification:** Conditionally essential (non-essential classically, but often insufficient endogenously)
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Gly / G
- **Side chain:** Hydrogen (–H); no chirality; smallest amino acid; allows unusual main-chain flexibility
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Glucogenic (→ serine → pyruvate)

## Dietary Requirements

| Condition | Notes |
|---|---|
| Healthy adults | No RDA established; estimated total need ~10–14 g/day; endogenous synthesis ~3 g/day → dietary shortfall of ~7–10 g/day |
| Collagen synthesis demand | Collagen is ~33% glycine; growing children, pregnancy, wound healing, athletes significantly increase demand |
| Critical illness | Increased demand for detoxification, GSH synthesis (glycine is a GSH precursor), repair |

> No established UL. High doses (≥90 g/day) may cause CNS depression via glycine receptor activation. Typical supplemental doses (3–15 g/day) are well-tolerated.

## Functions

- **Collagen Structure:** Every third residue in the collagen triple helix is glycine (Gly-X-Y repeating unit) — the small side chain is essential to fit inside the helix. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body (~25% of total protein); glycine demand for collagen synthesis far exceeds endogenous synthesis capacity.
- **Inhibitory Neurotransmitter (CNS):** Glycine is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brainstem, spinal cord, and retina — acts via **strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors** (GlyR; chloride channel). Inhibits motoneuron discharge → muscle relaxation and spinal reflex control.
- **NMDA Receptor Co-agonist:** Glycine (or D-serine) is a mandatory co-agonist at the glycine binding site of NMDA glutamate receptors — both glycine and glutamate must bind for NMDA receptor to open. Important in synaptic plasticity, learning, memory.
- **Glutathione (GSH) Precursor:** γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-**glycine** — glycine is the third tripeptide component of GSH; glycine availability can limit GSH synthesis (especially in elderly and critically ill).
- **Bile Acid Conjugation:** Glycine (and taurine) conjugate primary bile acids (cholate, chenodeoxycholate) in the liver → glycocholate, glycochenodeoxycholate → emulsify dietary fats; facilitate fat-soluble vitamin absorption.
- **Creatine Synthesis:** Arginine + **Glycine** → Guanidinoacetate (AGAT; kidney) + Ornithine → Creatine (GAMT; liver). Creatine synthesis is a major consumer of dietary glycine.
- **One-Carbon Metabolism:** Glycine ↔ Serine (serine hydroxymethyltransferase; SHMT; B6, THF) — contributes one-carbon units to folate cycle for methylation and nucleotide synthesis.
- **Porphyrin / Haem Synthesis:** Glycine + Succinyl-CoA → δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) — the first and rate-limiting step in haem biosynthesis (ALA synthase; B6-dependent).
- **Purine Synthesis:** Glycine is directly incorporated into the purine ring (as C4, C5, N7 of the imidazole ring) — essential for nucleotide biosynthesis.
- **Detoxification (Conjugation):** Glycine conjugates benzoate → hippurate (excreted in urine); conjugates xenobiotics and drug metabolites for urinary excretion.
- **Anti-inflammatory Glycine Receptor (Gly-activated Cl⁻ channel on macrophages and hepatocytes):** Glycine hyperpolarises macrophages and Kupffer cells via GlyR → reduces TNF-α, IL-1, NO release → anti-inflammatory. Active area in liver protection and surgery research.

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Synthesis** | Serine → Glycine (SHMT; B6, THF; reversible); Threonine aldolase (minor); Choline → betaine → glycine |
| **Degradation** | Glycine cleavage system (GCS/GLDC; P, H, T, L proteins; requires B2, B6, lipoic acid) — glycine → CO₂ + NH₄⁺ + methylene-THF |
| **Collagen pathway** | Gly incorporated into pro-collagen Gly-X-Y repeats; hydroxylation of X and Y (Pro, Lys) requires Vit C |
| **Haem synthesis** | Gly + Succinyl-CoA → ALA (ALA synthase; B6) → porphyrins → haem |
| **Creatine** | Gly + Arg → Guanidinoacetate (AGAT; kidney) → Creatine (GAMT; liver; SAM) |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Glycine (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Pork skin / gelatin | 10g dry gelatin | ~2,000–2,500 mg |
| Beef (lean, cooked) | 85g | ~1,350 mg |
| Chicken (cooked) | 85g | ~1,100 mg |
| Collagen peptide powder | 10g | ~2,000–2,600 mg |
| Salmon (cooked) | 85g | ~730 mg |
| Pumpkin seeds | 28g | ~430 mg |
| Lentils (cooked) | 200g | ~580 mg |
| Egg | 1 large | ~200 mg |

> Collagen is the richest food source of glycine; muscle meat (fillets) is lower in glycine than connective tissue–rich cuts (oxtail, bone broth, pig's trotters, skin). Bone broth provides significant glycine.

## Clinical Relevance

### Non-Ketotic Hyperglycinaemia (NKH / Glycine Encephalopathy)
- Defect in the **glycine cleavage system (GCS)**; autosomal recessive
- Accumulation of glycine in blood and CSF → neonatal hypotonia, seizures, apnoea, severe intellectual disability or death
- Excess glycine over-activates NMDA receptors (co-agonist site) + glycine receptors → excitotoxicity paradoxically from an inhibitory amino acid at non-inhibitory receptors
- Treatment: sodium benzoate (conjugates glycine → hippurate, excreted), NMDA antagonists (dextromethorphan, ketamine) — outcomes are poor in severe forms

### Methylmalonic Acidaemia / Propionic Acidaemia
- Glycine conjugates propionyl-CoA → propionylglycine; urinary propionylglycine is a diagnostic marker

### Strychnine Poisoning
- Strychnine blocks glycine receptors (GlyR) in spinal cord → loss of inhibitory interneuron function → violent tetanic convulsions (muscle hyperexcitability)
- Antidote: supportive care, benzodiazepines; highlights critical role of glycine in spinal inhibition

### Schizophrenia (NMDA Hypofunction Hypothesis)
- Glycine (3–80 g/day) and D-cycloserine (partial GlyR agonist) studied as adjuncts in schizophrenia to enhance NMDA receptor co-agonist activity
- Some trials show modest improvement in negative symptoms; not standard of care

### Metabolic Syndrome and Insulin Resistance
- Low plasma glycine is consistently observed in obesity, insulin resistance, and T2DM
- Glycine supplementation (9 g/day) in one RCT improved insulin sensitivity in obese subjects; mechanism unclear (possibly improved mitochondrial function, reduced inflammation, improved GSH)

### Sleep Quality
- **Glycine 3 g orally before bedtime:** RCTs show improved subjective sleep quality, reduced daytime sleepiness, and reduced core body temperature (possibly via hypothalamic glycine receptors)
- One of the better-supported non-pharmacological sleep interventions

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Vitamin B6** | SHMT (Gly↔Ser), ALA synthase (haem), and glycine cleavage H-protein all require PLP |
| **Folate (THF)** | SHMT reaction couples glycine-serine interconversion to the folate one-carbon cycle |
| **Vitamin C** | Required for prolyl/lysyl hydroxylation in collagen (acts on the X and Y positions adjacent to glycine) |
| **Zinc** | Supports ALA dehydratase (second step of haem synthesis, downstream of glycine entry); also binds metalloproteins where glycine-rich motifs are present |
| **Sodium benzoate** | Conjugates with glycine → hippurate (excreted in urine) → reduces plasma glycine; used therapeutically in NKH and urea cycle disorders |
| **NMDA receptor drugs** | Glycine co-agonist site is target for memantine (partial), D-cycloserine, and is relevant in ketamine mechanism of action |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Collagen peptide supplements (5–15 g/day):** Rich in glycine, proline, hydroxyproline; evidence supports joint pain reduction (knee OA), skin elasticity improvement, and reduction in exercise-related joint discomfort
- **L-Glycine powder (3–5 g before bed):** Well-supported for improving sleep quality (RCTs); also used for anxiety and GI comfort
- **Glycine for metabolic health:** Early evidence for insulin sensitivity, anti-inflammatory effects; larger trials needed
- Both glycine and taurine (another Cys/Met-derived compound) are essential for bile acid conjugation — together they ensure adequate fat-soluble vitamin absorption
- High-quality protein with organ meats, connective tissue, and bone broth increases dietary glycine significantly compared to a muscle-meat–only diet
