# Proline

## Overview
Proline is a **conditionally essential amino acid** with a unique cyclic structure — its side chain is bonded to both the α-carbon and the nitrogen, forming a **pyrrolidine ring**. This makes proline the only **imino acid** among the standard 20 amino acids and gives it exceptional conformational rigidity. Proline is the second most abundant amino acid in **collagen** (after glycine), essential for forming the collagen triple helix, and plays distinctive roles in protein folding, turn formation, and as a **stress-responsive osmolyte** in many organisms. It can be synthesised from glutamate or arginine.

- **Classification:** Conditionally essential
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Pro / P
- **Side chain:** Pyrrolidine ring (cyclic — N is part of the ring); rigid; disrupts α-helices and β-sheets → introduces β-turns
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Glucogenic (→ glutamate → α-ketoglutarate)

## Dietary Requirements

| Condition | Notes |
|---|---|
| Healthy adults | Synthesised from glutamate; no established RDA; estimated 2–4 g/day from mixed diet |
| Collagen synthesis / growth / healing | Increased demand; connective tissue synthesis requires proline and hydroxyproline in large amounts |
| Premature infants / severe illness | Endogenous synthesis may be insufficient |

> No established UL. Proline supplementation in typical doses (1–10 g/day) is considered safe.

## Functions

- **Collagen Triple Helix Formation:** Collagen Gly-X-Y repeating structure uses **proline (Pro)** frequently in the X position and **hydroxyproline (Hyp)** in the Y position. Hydroxylation of Pro → 4-hydroxyproline (by prolyl 4-hydroxylase; requires vitamin C and iron) creates **hydrogen bonds that stabilise the three-chain triple helix** — without hydroxyproline, collagen unwinds and becomes non-functional (scurvy mechanism).
- **Protein Structure and Folding:** The cyclic ring prevents rotation around the N-Cα bond → induces σ-turns, β-turns, poly-proline helices. Prolines break α-helices and redirect polypeptide chain direction → critical in signalling peptides and receptor binding regions.
- **Collagen Post-Translational Processing:** Pro is also 3-hydroxylated (by P3H1) in collagen → 3-hydroxyproline; contributes to fibril architecture.
- **Energy Substrate (especially in insects; lesser role in mammals):** Proline → glutamate → α-KG → TCA cycle; serves as mobile fuel in flight muscle of insects; in humans provides gluconeogenic substrate during fasting.
- **Antioxidant / Stress Osmolyte:** Proline accumulates in plants under osmotic/salt/drought stress and protects macromolecules. In humans, elevated proline levels are found in certain stressed cells; role as osmolyte is minor compared to plants.
- **Skin and Joint Integrity:** Hydroxyproline is ~13% of collagen; dietary hydroxyproline (from collagen-rich foods) and proline availability are rate-limiting factors for de novo collagen synthesis in skin, cartilage, tendons, and bone matrix.
- **Glutamate Metabolism:** Proline ↔ glutamate interconversion (via P5CS, PYCR, and PRODH enzymes) — connects the urea cycle, TCA cycle, and amino acid metabolism. Proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) in the mitochondria generates ROS (used to signal apoptosis in cancer cells).
- **Gut Microbiome Metabolism:** Proline-rich proteins (salivary proteins, collagen) are a substrate for gut bacteria; the microbiome modulates proline availability.

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Synthesis from Glu** | Glu → Glu-5-semialdehyde (P5CS; ATP + NADPH) → Δ¹-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) → Proline (PYCR; NADPH) |
| **Synthesis from Arg** | Arg → Ornithine → P5C → Proline (PRODH/P5CR pathway in some tissues) |
| **Collagen hydroxylation** | Pro → 4-hydroxyproline (prolyl 4-hydroxylase; O₂, α-KG, Fe²⁺, ascorbate) |
| **Catabolism** | Pro → P5C (PRODH; mitochondria) → Glu → α-KG → TCA cycle |
| **Urea cycle connection** | Ornithine (from arginine/urea cycle) → P5C → Proline |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Proline (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Gelatin / collagen peptide | 10g | ~2,100–2,800 mg |
| Beef (lean, cooked) | 85g | ~800–1,000 mg |
| Chicken (cooked) | 85g | ~750–900 mg |
| Bone broth (1 cup) | 240 mL | ~1,200 mg |
| Egg white | 1 large | ~190 mg |
| Whole wheat flour | 30g | ~400 mg |
| Casein protein | 30g | ~800 mg |
| Lentils (cooked) | 200g | ~540 mg |

> Animal connective tissue (skin, cartilage, tendons) and gelatin are the richest dietary sources. Collagen peptide supplements are primarily glycine + proline + hydroxyproline.

## Clinical Relevance

### Scurvy (Vitamin C Deficiency)
- Vitamin C is the cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase → without ascorbate, proline cannot be hydroxylated → immature collagen chains unfold (lack of hydroxyproline-mediated hydrogen bonds) → structurally weak collagen
- Results in: perifollicular haemorrhages, gingival disease, poor wound healing, corkscrew hairs, subperiosteal haemorrhages → clinically, this is primarily a proline hydroxylation failure

### Hyperprolinaemia
- **Type I:** PRODH deficiency — proline accumulates; associated with schizophrenia (PRODH gene at chromosome 22q11.2 — DiGeorge/velo-cardio-facial syndrome region); 22q11.2 deletion includes PRODH
- **Type II:** P5CDH deficiency — P5C and proline accumulate; more severe; intellectual disability, seizures, renal reabsorption defect; elevated plasma + urine proline; P5C accumulates and inactivates pyridoxal phosphate → secondary B6 deficiency

### Cartilage and Joint Disease
- Hydroxyproline is the most abundant amino acid in cartilage collagen; joint tissue turnover depends on dietary proline availability
- Collagen peptide supplementation (5–15 g/day) → randomised trials show improvements in knee OA pain and function (WOMAC scores); evidence for athletes re: cartilage regeneration is building

### DiGeorge Syndrome / 22q11.2 Deletion
- PRODH (proline dehydrogenase) gene deletion → hyperprolinaemia type I
- PRODH links proline to mitochondrial ROS production and synaptic glutamate → neurodevelopmental effects; possible mechanism for psychiatric features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome

### EhlersDanlos Syndrome / Osteogenesis Imperfecta
- Genetic defects in collagen synthesis enzymes (prolyl hydroxylases, collagen chain genes) → structurally weak collagen despite adequate proline
- Demonstrates that proline availability alone is necessary but not sufficient; enzymatic machinery is equally critical

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Vitamin C** | Essential cofactor for prolyl 4-hydroxylase; deficiency → unhydroxylated collagen → unstable triple helix |
| **Iron (Fe²⁺)** | Also a cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase; iron deficiency can impair collagen maturation (independent of Vit C) |
| **Glycine** | Co-dominant in collagen (Gly-Pro-Hyp is the canonical collagen tripeptide) — both must be co-adequate |
| **Glutamate / Arginine** | Upstream precursors of proline — adequate glutamate and arginine availability supports proline synthesis |
| **B6 (PLP)** | Type II hyperprolinaemia — accumulated P5C inactivates PLP → functional B6 deficiency, seizures |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Collagen peptide supplements (5–15 g/day):** Most widely used form; rich in glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline; bioavailable di/tripeptides (Pro-Hyp, Gly-Pro-Hyp) reach blood and joints intact
- **Evidence base:** Joint health (OA), skin elasticity (reduces wrinkles modestly), bone mineral density (combined with calcium)
- **L-Proline powder:** Available but less studied than collagen peptides; proline in collagen hydrolysate form is better absorbed and targeted than free L-proline
- **Bone broth:** Natural source of proline + hydroxyproline + glycine; variable amounts; flavourful but difficult to quantify exact content
- No documented toxicity at typical supplemental doses; extremely high doses not studied systematically
