# Histidine

## Overview
Histidine is an **essential amino acid** — it cannot be synthesised in adequate amounts by the body and must be obtained from the diet. It is unique among essential amino acids in that it was historically classified as "semi-essential" because adults can synthesise small amounts, but this is insufficient for normal function. It is the precursor of **histamine**, a key mediator of immune responses, gastric acid secretion, and neurotransmission. It also forms part of the active site of many enzymes (as the imidazole side chain acts as both a proton donor and acceptor near physiological pH).

- **Classification:** Essential (9 essential amino acids)
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** His / H
- **Side chain:** Imidazole group; pKa ~6.0 — unique buffering capacity near physiological pH
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Glucogenic (converted to α-ketoglutarate)

## Dietary Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA (mg/kg/day) | Approximate daily need |
|---|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | ~36 mg/kg/day | — |
| Children 1–3 years | ~22 mg/kg/day | ~490 mg/day |
| Adults 19+ | ~14 mg/kg/day | ~980 mg/day (70 kg adult) |
| Pregnant Women | Higher requirements | ~1,000–1,100 mg/day |

> No established UL for histidine from food. High-dose supplements (> 4 g/day) have been associated with adverse effects.

## Functions

- **Histamine Precursor:** Decarboxylated by histidine decarboxylase to form histamine — mediates allergic responses, gastric acid secretion (H2 receptors on parietal cells), vasodilation, wakefulness, and neurotransmission.
- **Haemoglobin Buffering:** The imidazole side chains of histidine residues in haemoglobin (the Bohr effect) facilitate CO₂ transport and O₂ release in tissues.
- **Carnosine Synthesis:** β-alanine + histidine → **carnosine** (dipeptide) — high concentrations in muscle and brain; buffers lactic acid during exercise, antioxidant, inhibits protein glycation.
- **Enzyme Active Sites:** Histidine residues are critical catalytic residues in serine proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, thrombin), kinases, and phosphatases.
- **Metal Chelation:** Imidazole ring coordinates zinc, copper, iron in metalloenzymes (e.g., carbonic anhydrase).
- **Folate Metabolism:** Histidine is catabolised through the formiminoglutamate (FIGLU) pathway, consuming tetrahydrofolate — FIGLU accumulates in folate deficiency (used in FIGLU excretion test for folate status).
- **Immune Regulation:** Histamine derived from histidine modulates innate and adaptive immune responses.

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Active transport in the small intestine (SLC6A19, SLC36 transporters) |
| **Catabolism** | Histidine → urocanate → imidazolonepropionate → formimino-glutamate → glutamate → TCA cycle |
| **Key enzyme** | Histidase (HAL gene) — deficiency causes histidinaemia |
| **Histamine synthesis** | Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) — mast cells, enterochromaffin-like cells, neurons, macrophages |

| Chicken breast (cooked) | 85g | ~800 mg |
| Tuna (canned) | 85g | ~870 mg |
| Salmon (cooked) | 85g | ~750 mg |
| Parmesan cheese | 28g | ~440 mg |
| Lentils (cooked) | 200g | ~530 mg |
| Quinoa (cooked) | 185g | ~360 mg |
| Egg | 1 large | ~295 mg |

## Clinical Relevance

### Histidinaemia
- Autosomal recessive deficiency of **histidase**
- Accumulation of histidine and downstream metabolites (urocanate, imidazole pyruvate)
- Historically considered benign; surveillance continues but severe neurological effects are uncommon

### Histamine Intolerance / Mast Cell Activation
- Excess dietary histidine or histamine (aged cheese, fermented foods, wine) → symptoms in individuals with reduced diamine oxidase (DAO) or histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) activity
- Symptoms: flushing, urticaria, rhinorrhoea, headache, palpitations

### Folate Deficiency Diagnosis
- FIGLU excretion test: oral histidine load → measure urinary FIGLU
- Elevated FIGLU indicates folate deficiency (impaired FIGLU conversion requires tetrahydrofolate)

### Joint Conditions
- Histidine is depleted in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients — mechanism unclear; possibly due to elevated histaminase or increased demand
- Some trials have supplemented histidine in RA with modest benefit

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Folate (B9)** | Required for FIGLU → glutamate conversion; histidine loading reveals folate status |
| **Zinc / Copper** | Histidine chelates and aids transport of zinc and copper across intestinal epithelium |
| **Antihistamines (H1/H2 blockers)** | Block histamine receptors — do not affect histidine absorption but modulate downstream histamine effects |
| **Proton pump inhibitors** | Reduce gastric acid — same target pathway as histamine (H2 receptor on parietal cells) |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Carnosine supplements** provide histidine + β-alanine; used by athletes for intramuscular buffering
- High-dose isolated histidine supplementation (>4 g/day) is not recommended without medical supervision
- Histidine-rich infant formulas are critical — infants have higher relative requirements than adults
