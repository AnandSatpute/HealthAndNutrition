# Isoleucine

## Overview
Isoleucine is an **essential amino acid** and one of three branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), alongside leucine and valine. While leucine is the dominant mTORC1 activator, isoleucine's primary metabolic role is in **glucose transport and uptake** in muscle — it independently stimulates GLUT4 translocation and glucose disposal. Isoleucine is both glucogenic and ketogenic, and its catabolism is tightly linked to energy metabolism in muscle.

- **Classification:** Essential; Branched-Chain Amino Acid (BCAA)
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Ile / I
- **Side chain:** Branched aliphatic (methylethyl group); has two stereocentres
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Both (→ succinyl-CoA \[glucogenic\] and acetyl-CoA \[ketogenic\])

## Dietary Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA (mg/kg/day) | Approximate daily need |
|---|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | ~58 mg/kg/day | — |
| Children 1–3 years | ~36 mg/kg/day | ~800 mg/day |
| Adults 19+ | ~19 mg/kg/day | ~1,330 mg/day (70 kg adult) |

> No established UL for isoleucine from food. Taken in isolation, high-dose isoleucine may disturb BCAA balance by competing with leucine and valine at shared transporters.

## Functions

- **Glucose Uptake in Muscle:** Isoleucine independently stimulates GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in skeletal muscle — increases glucose uptake even in the absence of insulin (via PI3K/Akt signalling). This is distinct from leucine's role and makes isoleucine important for post-exercise glucose disposal.
- **Glycogen Synthesis:** Promotes muscle glycogen resynthesis in the post-exercise window.
- **mTORC1 Activation (minor):** Contributes to mTOR signalling but is significantly less potent than leucine.
- **Haemoglobin Structure:** Isoleucine is a component of haemoglobin — the substitution Glu6→Val (sickle cell) is adjacent; comparable mutations at other sites can affect stability.
- **Immune Function:** Supports synthesis of β-defensins (antimicrobial peptides produced by intestinal epithelium), contributing to innate mucosal immunity.
- **Protein Synthesis Substrate:** Essential structural component of muscle, connective tissue, and visceral proteins.
- **Energy Supply:** Catabolised in muscle during prolonged exercise, providing acetyl-CoA to the TCA cycle.

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Active transport via LAT1 (SLC7A5) — shared transporter with leucine, valine, and aromatic amino acids |
| **First-pass metabolism** | Low hepatic extraction; preferentially taken up by muscle and adipose tissue |
| **Catabolism** | Ile → α-methylbutyryl-CoA → propionyl-CoA (→ succinyl-CoA, glucogenic) + acetyl-CoA (ketogenic) |
| **Key enzyme** | Branched-Chain α-Keto Acid Dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex — same as leucine and valine |
| **Regulation** | Muscle exercise increases BCKD activity; insulin inhibits BCAA catabolism (promotes protein synthesis) |

## Clinical Relevance

### Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD)
- BCKD complex deficiency — isoleucine accumulates alongside leucine and valine
- Isoleucine is toxic in excess (neurological), but leucine is the primary driver of encephalopathy
- Management: BCAA-restricted diet; branched-chain keto acid–supplemented medical formulas; liver transplant

### Isovaleric Acidaemia (not isoleucine-specific)
- Affects leucine catabolism (isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase); isoleucine catabolism is separate

### Post-Exercise Glucose Disposal
- GLUT4 translocation by isoleucine is relevant in the context of post-workout nutrition — supports glycogen resynthesis and mirrors some insulin-like actions

### BCAA Ratio in Supplementation
- Excess isolated leucine supplementation reduces isoleucine plasma concentration (transporter competition) — reinforces the importance of balanced BCAA ratios (2:1:1 Leu:Ile:Val)

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Leucine + Valine** | Compete at LAT1; high leucine reduces isoleucine uptake; balanced BCAA ratios recommended |
| **B vitamins (B1, B2, B3, lipoic acid)** | Required cofactors for the BCKD complex — isoleucine catabolism depends on these |
| **Insulin** | Insulin suppresses BCAA (incl. isoleucine) catabolism — promotes protein anabolism |
| **Glucose** | Isoleucine-mediated GLUT4 upregulation is additive with insulin-stimulated glucose uptake |

## Supplementation Notes
- Sold as part of **BCAA supplements** (typically 2:1:1 Leu:Ile:Val)
- Rarely supplemented in isolation; imbalance without co-supplementation of leucine/valine is counterproductive
- Some evidence that BCAAs (including isoleucine) reduce exercise-induced muscle soreness and protect lean mass during caloric restriction
- Athletes consuming sufficient high-quality protein (≥1.6 g/kg/day) are unlikely to need additional BCAA supplementation
