# Lysine

## Overview
Lysine is an **essential amino acid** and the most commonly limiting amino acid in cereal-grain–based diets. It is critical for **collagen synthesis and cross-linking**, immune function, and **carnitine biosynthesis**. Lysine has a positively charged ε-amino group that participates in key post-translational modifications (acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination) on histone proteins — directly linking lysine to **epigenetic regulation** of gene expression.

- **Classification:** Essential (9 essential amino acids)
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Lys / K
- **Side chain:** ε-amino group (pKa ~10.5); positively charged at physiological pH
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Exclusively **ketogenic** (along with leucine — the only two strictly ketogenic essential amino acids; → acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate)

## Dietary Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA (mg/kg/day) | Approximate daily need |
|---|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | ~99 mg/kg/day | — |
| Children 1–3 years | ~62 mg/kg/day | ~1,365 mg/day |
| Adults 19+ | ~38 mg/kg/day | ~2,660 mg/day (70 kg adult) |
| Pregnant Women | Higher | ~3,100 mg/day |

> No established UL from food sources. Supplemental doses of 1–3 g/day are used clinically. Very high doses (>15 g/day) have caused GI symptoms and tubulointerstitial nephritis in isolated case reports.

## Functions

- **Collagen Synthesis:** Lysine residues are hydroxylated by **prolyl hydroxylase** (requires vitamin C) to form **hydroxylysine** — essential for cross-linking collagen fibrils via lysyl oxidase (requires copper). Without adequate lysine or vitamin C → weakened connective tissue, poor wound healing.
- **Carnitine Biosynthesis:** Lysine (and methionine) → butyrobetaine → **L-carnitine** (requires vitamin C, B6, niacin, iron as cofactors). Carnitine is essential for long-chain fatty acid transport into mitochondria for β-oxidation.
- **Calcium Absorption:** Lysine increases intestinal calcium absorption and reduces urinary calcium excretion — may play a role in bone mineral density maintenance.
- **Antiviral Activity (Herpes simplex):** Arginine is required for HSV replication; lysine competes with arginine for intestinal absorption and intracellular uptake — lysine supplementation reduces HSV recurrence frequency and severity in clinical trials.
- **Histone Modification:** ε-amino groups of histone lysine residues undergo:
  - **Acetylation** (by HATs) → gene activation
  - **Methylation** (by HMTs) → activation or repression depending on position (H3K4me3 = active; H3K27me3 = repressive)
  - **Ubiquitination** → protein degradation (via proteasome) or signalling
- **Enzyme Structure:** Lysine residues form hydrogen bonds and ion pairs central to enzyme active site architecture.
- **Antibody Production:** Lysine availability supports immunoglobulin synthesis.

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Active transport via b⁰,⁺ transporter (SLC7A9 / BAT1) and rBAT — shared with arginine, ornithine, cystine |
| **Catabolism (main)** | Saccharopine pathway (liver): Lys → saccharopine → aminoadipate semialdehyde → α-ketoadipate → acetyl-CoA |
| **Alternative pathway** | Pipecolic acid pathway (active in brain and peroxisomes) |
| **Carnitine synthesis** | Lys → ε-N-trimethyllysine → 3-hydroxy-trimethyllysine → carnitine precursors |
| **Hydroxylation** | Prolyl hydroxylase-like enzymes → hydroxylysine in collagen |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Lysine (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Beef (lean, cooked) | 85g | ~2,300 mg |
| Chicken breast (cooked) | 85g | ~2,200 mg |
| Tuna (canned) | 85g | ~2,100 mg |
| Eggs | 1 large | ~455 mg |
| Milk (whole) | 240 mL | ~660 mg |
| Parmesan cheese | 28g | ~780 mg |
| Lentils (cooked) | 200g | ~1,240 mg |
| Quinoa (cooked) | 185g | ~440 mg |
| Seitan (wheat gluten) | 100g | **very low** — lysine-deficient |

> Wheat, corn, and most cereal grains are **poor in lysine** — the primary limiting amino acid in plant-based and cereal-dominant diets. Legumes compensate (high lysine, low methionine).

## Clinical Relevance

### Lysinuric Protein Intolerance (LPI)
- Defect in the **y⁺LAT1–4F2hc** transporter (dibasic amino acid transporter)
- Impaired intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption of lysine, arginine, ornithine
- Results in urea cycle disruption (hyperammonaemia), protein intolerance, lung disease (PAP), haematological findings
- Treatment: low-protein diet, citrulline supplementation to bypass the defect, lysine supplementation (oral)

### Familial Hyperlysinaemia
- Bifunctional enzyme deficiency (aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase — AASS); generally benign
- Elevated plasma and urine lysine; usually an incidental amino acid screen finding

### Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Recurrence
- **Lysine supplementation (500–3,000 mg/day)** reduces frequency and severity of HSV outbreaks
- Mechanism: competes with arginine (required for HSV replication) at shared intestinal and cellular transporters
- Evidence: meta-analyses support decreased recurrence; effect size is moderate

### Collagen Disorders / Wound Healing
- Lysine deficiency → impaired collagen cross-linking → delayed healing, fragile connective tissue
- Relevant in severe malnutrition, elderly with protein-energy malnutrition

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Vitamin C** | Required for hydroxylysine formation (hydroxylation of lysine in collagen) and for carnitine synthesis |
| **Arginine** | Competitive antagonist — high arginine impairs lysine absorption; lysine:arginine ratio is relevant for HSV management |
| **Copper** | Lysyl oxidase (copper-dependent) forms collagen and elastin cross-links with hydroxylysine |
| **B6, B3, Iron** | Cofactors for carnitine biosynthesis from lysine and methionine |
| **Calcium** | Lysine enhances intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption; potential for co-supplementation in bone health protocols |

## Supplementation Notes
- **L-Lysine supplements (500–3,000 mg/day):** Used for HSV recurrence prevention; widely available OTC
- **Combined with Vitamin C:** Sometimes co-supplemented for collagen synthesis / wound healing support
- **Athletes:** Lysine is rarely limiting if total protein intake is adequate with varied sources (meat, dairy, legumes)
- **Vegan diets:** Should ensure adequate lysine through legumes (lentils, chickpeas, soy, tofu) — cereal-only diets risk lysine insufficiency
