# Tyrosine

## Overview
Tyrosine is a **conditionally essential amino acid** — it is synthesised from phenylalanine by **phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH)**, but becomes dietary-essential when phenylalanine intake is insufficient or in phenylketonuria (PKU), where PAH is deficient. Tyrosine is the precursor to the **catecholamines** (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine), **thyroid hormones** (T3, T4), and **melanin**. Its hydroxyl-containing phenol ring makes it a site of post-translational modifications including phosphorylation by receptor tyrosine kinases.

- **Classification:** Conditionally essential (essential in PKU)
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Tyr / Y
- **Side chain:** Para-hydroxyphenyl (phenol); weakly acidic hydroxyl (pKa ~10.1); aromatic, partially hydrophobic
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Both (→ fumarate \[glucogenic\] + acetoacetate \[ketogenic\])

## Dietary Requirements

| Age / Group | RDA (combined Phe + Tyr, mg/kg/day) |
|---|---|
| Adults | ~33 mg/kg/day (combined); tyrosine spares ~50% of phenylalanine need |
| PKU patients | Tyrosine becomes **fully essential**; supplemented in all PKU formulas |

> No established UL for dietary tyrosine. Isolated supplemental tyrosine at high doses (>7 g/day) may cause hyperthymia, anxiety, or headache in sensitive individuals.

## Functions

### Catecholamine Synthesis
Tyrosine → L-DOPA (tyrosine hydroxylase; TH; requires BH4, Fe²⁺) → Dopamine (AADC; B6) → Norepinephrine (DBH; vitamin C, copper) → Epinephrine (PNMT; SAM methyl donor)

- **Dopamine:** Motor control (basal ganglia), reward/motivation, prolactin inhibition, cognition, mood
- **Norepinephrine:** Sympathetic nervous system tone, arousal, attention, fight-or-flight vasoconstriction
- **Epinephrine:** Adrenal medulla; systemic stress response, glycogenolysis, lipolysis, cardiac stimulation

### Thyroid Hormone Synthesis
- Tyrosine residues in **thyroglobulin** are iodinated (TPO + I⁻) → MIT and DIT → coupled → T4 and T3
- T4 is converted to active T3 by iodothyronine deiodinases (selenium-dependent)

### Melanin Synthesis
- Tyr → DOPA → dopaquinone → eumelanin (black-brown) / pheomelanin (red-yellow) via **tyrosinase** (copper-dependent)
- Determines skin, hair, and eye pigmentation

### Protein Post-Translational Modifications
- **Tyrosine phosphorylation** by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs — EGFR, VEGFR, INSR, etc.) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (Src, JAK family) — central to growth factor signalling, insulin signalling, immune receptor activation
- **Tyrosine nitration** (by peroxynitrite): oxidative stress marker on proteins
- **Tyrosine sulfation** (in Golgi): modifies extracellular proteins and GPCRs

### Cognitive Performance Under Stress
- Catecholamines in the prefrontal cortex (dopamine, NE) are consumed during acute stress → tyrosine replenishment may maintain cognitive performance under cold, noise, or sleep-deprivation stress

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Synthesis from Phe** | Phe + O₂ + BH4 → Tyr + BH2 (phenylalanine hydroxylase, PAH; liver) |
| **Catecholamine pathway** | Tyr → L-DOPA (TH; BH4) → Dopamine (AADC; B6) → NE (DBH; Vit C, Cu) → Epi (PNMT; SAM) |
| **Thyroid pathway** | Tyr in thyroglobulin → iodinated by TPO → T3/T4 |
| **Melanin pathway** | Tyr → DOPA → dopaquinone → melanin (tyrosinase; Cu) |
| **Catabolism** | Tyr → 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate → homogentisate → maleylacetoacetate → fumarate + acetoacetate |

## Clinical Relevance

### Phenylketonuria (PKU)
- PAH deficiency → Phe accumulates → Tyr is depleted (cannot be made from Phe)
- PKU patients **must supplement tyrosine** as part of their Phe-restricted amino acid formula
- Tyr-deficient PKU → additional catecholamine and melanin deficiency (fair skin/hair, mood/cognitive issues)

### Alkaptonuria
- Homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase deficiency (downstream tyrosine catabolism)
- Accumulation of homogentisic acid → ochronosis (connective tissue darkening), arthritis, urine darkens on standing

### Tyrosinaemia (Types I, II, III)
- **Type I (Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase deficiency — FAH):** Hepatorenal tyrosinaemia; severe liver disease, renal Fanconi syndrome, neurological crises, hepatocellular carcinoma risk; succinylacetone (marker) inhibits porphyrin synthesis → porphyria-like crises
  - Treatment: **Nitisinone (NTBC)** — inhibits 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (upstream, prevents accumulation of toxic metabolites) + low Tyr/Phe diet + liver transplant
- **Type II (Tyrosine aminotransferase deficiency):** Ocular (corneal crystals), palmoplantar keratoderma, intellectual disability; treatment: low Tyr/Phe diet
- **Type III (HPD deficiency, 4-HPPD):** Mild; intermittent ataxia and intellectual disability

### Parkinson's Disease
- Loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra
- Treatment: **L-DOPA** (bypasses tyrosine hydroxylase rate-limiting step; given with carbidopa to prevent peripheral conversion)
- Tyrosine supplementation does not significantly boost CNS dopamine in established PD (TH is severely depleted)

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **BH4 (Tetrahydrobiopterin)** | Rate-limiting cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase (catecholamine synthesis) and phenylalanine hydroxylase |
| **Vitamin C** | Required for dopamine β-hydroxylase (NE synthesis); deficiency reduces NE production |
| **SAM (Methionine)** | Methyl donor for PNMT (epinephrine synthesis from NE) |
| **Copper** | DBH (NE synthesis), tyrosinase (melanin) — deficiency reduces NE and melanin |
| **Iodine + Selenium** | Required for thyroid hormone synthesis from tyrosine |
| **MAO inhibitors** | Block catecholamine/tyramine degradation — tyramine (from Tyr) in food can precipitate hypertensive crisis |
| **Levodopa (L-DOPA)** | Competes with tyrosine (and other large neutral amino acids) at LAT1 transporter; protein meals reduce L-DOPA absorption/efficacy |
| **Thyroid medications** | Levothyroxine is a synthetic form of T4 (tyrosine backbone + iodines) |

## Supplementation Notes
- **L-Tyrosine (500–2,000 mg, 30–60 min pre-stressor):** Used for acute cognitive performance under stress (sleep deprivation, cold, noise exposure) — several RCTs show modest benefit; effect is short-lived (acute dosing)
- **NALT (N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine):** More water-soluble but evidence for superior bioavailability is mixed; some studies show lower plasma Tyr conversion than L-Tyr
- **Not effective for:** Chronic mood disorders in the absence of catecholamine demand (baseline catecholamine-sufficient individuals); Parkinson's disease (TH enzyme is the absent bottleneck, not substrate)
- **Caution:** Avoid high-dose Tyr with MAOIs (tyramine accumulation risk); caution with hyperthyroidism (excess Tyr substrate for T3/T4 synthesis)
- **PKU formula:** All PKU amino acid formulas contain added tyrosine as an essential inclusion
