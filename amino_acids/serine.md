# Serine

## Overview
Serine is a **conditionally essential amino acid** with a hydroxymethyl side chain, synthesised de novo primarily from **3-phosphoglycerate** (a glycolytic intermediate) via the **phosphoserine pathway**. It is a metabolic crossroads amino acid: serine is the direct precursor of **glycine**, **cysteine**, **sphingolipids**, **phosphatidylserine**, **D-serine**, and it feeds one-carbon units into the folate cycle, nucleotide synthesis, and the methionine cycle. Serine is also the most common site of **protein phosphorylation** by serine/threonine kinases in cell signalling.

- **Classification:** Conditionally essential
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Ser / S
- **Side chain:** Hydroxymethyl (–CH₂–OH); polar, uncharged, small — hydroxyl can participate in H-bonding and phosphorylation
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Glucogenic (→ pyruvate)

## Dietary Requirements

| Condition | Notes |
|---|---|
| Healthy adults | Synthesised endogenously; no established RDA; ~2–3 g/day from typical diet |
| **Phosphoserine pathway defects** | Serine becomes fully essential in these rare inborn errors |
| Neurological conditions / myelination | High demand; CNS-specific serine synthesis (PHGDH) is particularly important in astrocytes |

> No established UL. Supplemental doses up to 10 g/day studied without significant adverse effects in certain conditions.

## Functions

- **Glycine Precursor:** Serine → Glycine (serine hydroxymethyltransferase; SHMT1/2; PLP, THF) + 5,10-methylene-THF — the primary route of glycine production in the body and a major one-carbon donor to the folate cycle.
- **Cysteine Precursor:** Serine + Homocysteine → Cystathionine (CBS; PLP) → Cysteine — serine provides the carbon backbone for cysteine in the transsulphuration pathway.
- **One-Carbon Metabolism / Folate Cycle:** The SHMT reaction interconverts Ser ↔ Gly and couples to the folate one-carbon cycle — supplies methylene-THF for thymidylate (dTMP) synthesis and formyl-THF for purine synthesis → links serine to DNA replication and methylation.
- **Sphingolipid Synthesis:** Serine + Palmitoyl-CoA → **Sphinganine** (serine palmitoyltransferase; SPT) — first and rate-limiting step in _de novo_ sphingolipid synthesis. Sphingolipids (sphingomyelin, ceramide, gangliosides) are critical membrane components, especially in myelin, and act as bioactive lipid signalling molecules (ceramide → apoptosis; sphingosine-1-phosphate → survival/migration).
- **Phosphatidylserine (PS) Synthesis:** Serine head group is incorporated into phosphatidylserine in the endoplasmic reticulum (by PS synthase 1 and 2) → PS is a major inner-leaflet phospholipid of cell membranes. PS flips to outer leaflet during apoptosis (eat-me signal for phagocytes). Brain PS is abundant — modulates protein kinase C, AKT, and PLC signalling.
- **D-Serine (NMDA Receptor Co-agonist):** Serine is racemised to **D-serine** by serine racemase (SRR) in astrocytes and neurons → D-serine is the principal endogenous co-agonist at the glycine-binding site of NMDA receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (where it predominates over glycine). D-serine is critical for synaptic plasticity (LTP), learning, and memory.
- **Protein Phosphorylation Site:** The hydroxyl of serine is phosphorylated by serine/threonine kinases (PKA, PKC, AKT, mTOR, CDK, CK2, etc.) → phosphoserine is the most abundant form of protein phosphorylation in cells; regulates virtually all cellular signalling processes.
- **Active Site Nucleophile (Serine Proteases):** Serine is the catalytic nucleophile in the active-site triad of serine proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, thrombin, plasmin, complement proteases, subtilisins) and serine hydrolases (acetylcholinesterase, lipases) — arguably the most catalytically important amino acid in biology.
- **Gluconeogenesis:** Serine → pyruvate (serine dehydratase; PLP) → gluconeogenesis substrate

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **De novo synthesis** | 3-Phosphoglycerate (glycolysis) → 3-Phosphoserine → Serine (phosphoserine pathway; 3 enzymes: PHGDH, PSAT1, PSPH) |
| **Serine ↔ Glycine** | SHMT1 (cytosolic) + SHMT2 (mitochondrial); PLP + THF cofactors; reversible |
| **D-Serine synthesis** | Serine racemase (SRR) → D-serine (brain-enriched) |
| **Catabolism** | Serine → Pyruvate (serine dehydratase; PLP) → TCA / gluconeogenesis |
| **Collagen-linked** | Serine provides the initiating sugar-attachment site for glycosaminoglycans (O-xylosylation) in proteoglycans |

## Clinical Relevance

### Serine Deficiency Syndromes (Phosphoserine Pathway Defects)
- **3-Phosphoglycerate Dehydrogenase (PHGDH) Deficiency:** Most common and severe; presents with congenital microcephaly, intractable seizures (infantile onset), profound intellectual disability, peripheral neuropathy
- **Phosphoserine Aminotransferase (PSAT1) Deficiency and Phosphoserine Phosphatase (PSPH) Deficiency:** Similar but variable severity
- **Treatment:** Oral L-serine supplementation (200–600 mg/kg/day) + glycine — dramatically improves seizure control and neurodevelopmental outcomes if started early; serine is the full therapeutic; one of the best examples of dietary amino acid as effective treatment for a neurological disorder

### Neu-Laxova Syndrome
- Severe lethal form of serine deficiency (PHGDH/PSAT1/PSPH defects) — multiple malformations including ichthyosis, limb abnormalities, brain anomalies; typically lethal perinatally

### Schizophrenia and D-Serine Hypofunction
- D-serine is the principal NMDA co-agonist in prefrontal cortex → D-serine depletion → NMDA hypofunction → psychosis-like symptoms (consistent with the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia)
- D-serine or L-serine (as D-serine precursor) supplementation trials in schizophrenia have shown improvement in negative and cognitive symptoms
- Sarcosine (N-methylglycine) inhibits glycine reuptake transporter (GlyT1) → increases glycine/D-serine levels at NMDA receptors → similar rationale

### Cancer Metabolism (Serine Synthesis Pathway)
- Many cancers overexpress PHGDH (especially triple-negative breast cancer, melanoma, glioma) — divert glycolytic flux → serine synthesis → one-carbon metabolism → nucleotides and NADPH for proliferation and redox defence
- PHGDH inhibitors and serine restriction are active areas of cancer metabolism research

### Lipid Disorders (SPT dysfunction)
- Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) mutations → hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1) — toxic 1-deoxy-sphinganine (doxSA) accumulates (due to using alanine instead of serine as substrate for SPT)
- Oral L-serine supplementation competes with alanine at SPT → reduces doxSA → improves neuropathy in clinical trials

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Vitamin B6 (PLP)** | Required for SHMT (Ser↔Gly), serine dehydratase, CBS (Ser + Hcy → cystathionine → cysteine); multiple serine-related enzymes need PLP |
| **Folate (THF)** | SHMT couples Ser→Gly to methylene-THF generation — serine is effectively a one-carbon donor to the folate pool |
| **Methionine cycle** | Serine → Gly → methylene-THF → 5-methyl-THF → methionine synthase → SAM — serine feeds into methylation capacity |
| **Glycine** | Interconvertible via SHMT; combined supplementation (Ser + Gly) is the standard treatment in serine deficiency disorders |
| **Palmitoyl-CoA** | Substrate partner in SPT reaction; dietary palmitate availability modulates ceramide and sphingolipid synthesis from serine |
| **D-Amino acid oxidase (DAAO)** | Degrades D-serine in the cerebellum/brainstem; DAAO inhibitors proposed as adjuncts for NMDA hypofunction conditions |

## Supplementation Notes
- **L-Serine (200–600 mg/kg/day) for serine deficiency disorders:** The most evidence-based use — dramatic improvements in neuropaediatric outcomes; essentially a therapeutic amino acid
- **L-Serine for HSAN1 (1-deoxy-sphingolipid neuropathy):** Phase 2 RCT (Fridman et al.) showed reduction in doxSA and stabilisation of neuropathy; FDA Orphan Drug designation
- **D-Serine supplements:** Available; studied for schizophrenia and cognitive enhancement — clinical use is investigational; liver/kidney DAAO activity breaks down D-serine
- **Phosphatidylserine (PS) soft gels (100–300 mg/day):** Related to serine but specifically the phospholipid form; FDA-qualified health claim for cognitive decline attenuation; cortisol blunting in athletes; some evidence for memory/focus in the elderly — though the PS on labels is soy-derived (plant PS ≠ bovine cortex PS used in older studies)
- Dietary serine needs are typically met in protein-replete individuals; deficiency most relevant in metabolic disorders and rare genetic conditions
