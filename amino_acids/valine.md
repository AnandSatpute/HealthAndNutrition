# Valine

## Overview
Valine is an **essential amino acid** and the smallest of the three branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). It plays multiple roles in muscle protein synthesis, CNS function, and energy metabolism. Unlike leucine (purely ketogenic) and isoleucine (both), valine is exclusively **glucogenic** — it provides an important glucose-sparing or gluconeogenic contribution during prolonged exercise and fasting. Its catabolism takes place primarily in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain.

- **Classification:** Essential; Branched-Chain Amino Acid (BCAA)
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Val / V
- **Side chain:** Isopropyl (branched aliphatic, hydrophobic)
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Exclusively **glucogenic** (→ succinyl-CoA via propionyl-CoA)

## Dietary Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA (mg/kg/day) | Approximate daily need |
|---|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | ~87 mg/kg/day | — |
| Children 1–3 years | ~43 mg/kg/day | ~950 mg/day |
| Adults 19+ | ~24 mg/kg/day | ~1,680 mg/day (70 kg adult) |

> No established UL. Excessive isolated valine supplementation without leucine/isoleucine can disrupt BCAA balance and impair the others' LAT1 transport.

## Functions

- **Muscle Protein Synthesis Substrate:** Component of muscle structural proteins; contributes to mTORC1 activation alongside leucine (though less potently).
- **Gluconeogenic Substrate:** Valine is catabolised to succinyl-CoA, which feeds into the TCA cycle or can exit for gluconeogenesis — important fuel source during prolonged starvation or endurance exercise when muscle proteins are catabolised.
- **Nitrogen Balance:** Like all BCAAs, valine is transaminated in muscle (rather than liver) — the released amino group is transferred to pyruvate → alanine → exported to liver for urea synthesis (glucose-alanine cycle).
- **Myelin Synthesis:** Propionyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA from valine catabolism contribute to neuronal lipid synthesis; severe MSUD (with valine accumulation) contributes to white matter abnormalities.
- **Haemoglobin Participation:** Val6 in the β-globin chain — the canonical target of the sickle cell mutation (Glu→Val substitution creates HbS).
- **CNS Function:** Valine competes with tryptophan and other large neutral amino acids at LAT1 for blood-brain barrier entry — high BCAA levels (including valine) reduce serotonin synthesis by limiting Trp brain uptake.

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | LAT1 (SLC7A5) — competitive with leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan |
| **First-pass metabolism** | Minimal hepatic extraction; preferentially metabolised in skeletal muscle and brain |
| **Transamination** | Val → 2-ketoisovalerate (KIV) by BCAA aminotransferase (BCAT1, BCAT2) — releases NH₂ to α-ketoglutarate → glutamate |
| **Oxidative decarboxylation** | KIV → isobutyryl-CoA (BCKD complex; requires B1, B2, B3, lipoic acid) |
| **Glucogenic end products** | Isobutyryl-CoA → methylmalonyl-CoA → succinyl-CoA → TCA / gluconeogenesis |

## Clinical Relevance

### Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD)
- Deficiency of the **BCKD complex** — all three BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, **valine**) accumulate
- Valine and isoleucine contribute to general amino acid toxicity and osmotic effects; leucine is considered the primary neurotoxicant
- Classic presentation: failure to thrive, encephalopathy, alternating hypotonia and hypertonia, maple syrup odour (isovaleric acid)
- Management: BCAA-restricted diet using synthetic formula; leucine-lowered specifically; liver transplant (curative)

### Sickle Cell Disease
- **Val6 in β-globin** (Glu6Val mutation) — substituting a charged residue (glutamate) with hydrophobic valine creates a hydrophobic patch that promotes HbS polymerisation under low O₂ → sickling of erythrocytes

### Methylmalonic Acidaemia (MMA)
- Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency (or B12 deficiency of adenosylcobalamin form) → methylmalonyl-CoA accumulates → methylmalonic acid in blood/urine
- Valine, isoleucine, methionine, threonine all contribute propionyl-CoA → methylmalonyl-CoA (this pathway is affected)
- Treatment: protein restriction, high-carbohydrate diet, B12 supplementation (if responsive), organ transplant

### Propionic Acidaemia
- Propionyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency → propionyl-CoA accumulates (from valine, isoleucine, methionine, threonine, odd-chain fatty acids)
- Hyperammonaemia, metabolic acidosis, cardiomyopathy
- Treatment: low-protein diet, biotin supplementation (cofactor), liver/heart-liver transplant

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Leucine + Isoleucine** | Compete at LAT1 transporter; must be balanced in supplements (2:1:1 Leu:Ile:Val) |
| **B vitamins (B1, B2, B3, lipoic acid)** | Cofactors for the BCKD complex — valine catabolism depends on adequate B-vitamin status |
| **B12 (adenosylcobalamin)** | Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase requires adenosylcobalamin — B12 deficiency → methylmalonic acid accumulation from valine catabolism |
| **Tryptophan** | High valine (and BCAA) intakes reduce tryptophan CNS uptake via LAT1 competition → reduced serotonin synthesis |
| **Insulin** | Insulin drives BCAA uptake into muscle and suppresses catabolism — promotes protein anabolism |

## Supplementation Notes
- Sold as part of **BCAA supplements** (2:1:1 Leu:Ile:Val ratio); rarely supplemented in isolation
- Isolated valine supplementation disrupts leucine/isoleucine balance and is not recommended
- BCAA supplements show modest evidence for:
  - Reducing exercise-induced muscle damage and soreness (DOMS)
  - Preserving lean mass during caloric restriction
  - Reducing hepatic encephalopathy symptoms (high BCAA:aromatic amino acid ratio — Fischer ratio — used in hepatic encephalopathy nutrition protocols)
- Adequate dietary protein (≥1.6 g/kg/day) from quality sources makes BCAA supplements unnecessary for most people
