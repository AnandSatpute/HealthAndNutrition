# Methylation: A Comprehensive Overview

Methylation is one of the most fundamental biochemical processes in the body — it's essentially the transfer of a **methyl group (–CH₃)** from one molecule to another. This simple reaction, happening billions of times per second, governs gene expression, neurotransmitter synthesis, detoxification, immune function, and much more.

## 🔬 The Core Chemistry

A **methyl group** is just one carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms (–CH₃). Methylation is the act of adding this group to a substrate — a DNA base, a protein, a neurotransmitter, a toxin, etc.

The **universal methyl donor** in the body is **SAM (S-Adenosylmethionine)**, which is synthesized from methionine (an essential amino acid) and ATP.

```
Methionine + ATP → SAM → (donates –CH₃) → SAH (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)
                                                  ↓
                                           Homocysteine
                                                  ↓
                          (via B12/folate/B6) → Methionine (recycled)
```

When SAM donates its methyl group, it becomes **SAH**, then **homocysteine**. Homocysteine is either:
- **Re-methylated** back to methionine (requires B12 + methylfolate/5-MTHF), or
- **Transsulfurated** to cysteine → glutathione (requires B6)

> **Elevated homocysteine** is a marker of impaired methylation and is associated with cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and inflammation.

## 🧬 1. DNA Methylation (Epigenetics)

This is the most studied form. DNA methylation **silences gene expression** without altering the DNA sequence — this is epigenetics.

### Mechanism
- A **DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)** enzyme adds a methyl group to the **5-position of cytosine** (5-methylcytosine, or 5mC), almost always at **CpG dinucleotides** (cytosine next to guanine).
- Methylated CpG islands in a gene's **promoter region** → gene is **silenced**.
- Unmethylated promoters → gene is **expressed**.

### Why It Matters
| State | Effect |
|---|---|
| Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes | Cancer risk ↑ |
| Hypomethylation of oncogenes | Cancer risk ↑ |
| Appropriate methylation of imprinted genes | Normal development |
| Methylation of viral DNA sequences | Immune defense |
| Loss of methylation patterns | Aging, Alzheimer's |

### Inheritance
Methylation patterns can be passed to daughter cells during cell division (**mitotic inheritance**) and in some cases across generations (**transgenerational epigenetics**).

## 🧠 2. Neurotransmitter Synthesis & Breakdown

Methylation is **critical for brain chemistry**:

| Reaction | Enzyme | Cofactor |
|---|---|---|
| Norepinephrine → Epinephrine | PNMT | SAM |
| Serotonin → Melatonin | ASMT | SAM |
| Dopamine breakdown | COMT | SAM, Mg²⁺ |
| Histamine breakdown | HNMT | SAM |

**COMT (Catechol-O-Methyltransferase)** is particularly important — it methylates and inactivates catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine). The common **COMT Val158Met SNP** slows this enzyme, leading to higher dopamine/norepinephrine levels, which can affect mood, stress response, and pain sensitivity.

## 🛡️ 3. Detoxification

The liver uses methylation in **Phase II detoxification** to neutralize and excrete:

- **Estrogens** — methylation converts 2-OHE1 (less harmful) to 2-methoxyestrone (excreted). Impaired methylation → accumulation of 16α-OHE1 (more carcinogenic)
- **Heavy metals** — arsenic is methylated for urinary excretion
- **Drugs & xenobiotics** — many medications are methylated for clearance
- **Toxins** — various environmental chemicals

---

## 💊 4. Phospholipid & Membrane Synthesis

Methylation is required to synthesize **phosphatidylcholine (PC)**, a key component of every cell membrane, via the **PEMT pathway**:

```
Phosphatidylethanolamine → (3× methylation via PEMT + SAM) → Phosphatidylcholine
```

This is why choline is so important — it spares the methylation demand. Low choline intake increases the methylation burden on SAM.

## 🔁 5. The Folate Cycle & One-Carbon Metabolism

Methylation doesn't work in isolation — it's part of the **one-carbon metabolism network**, which includes:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  FOLATE CYCLE                           │
│  Dietary Folate → DHF → THF → 5,10-MTHF → 5-MTHF      │
│                                    ↕             ↓      │
│              (via MTHFR enzyme)          Homocysteine   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                                 ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│               METHIONINE CYCLE                          │
│   Homocysteine → (B12 + 5-MTHF) → Methionine → SAM    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Enzyme: MTHFR
**Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase** converts 5,10-MTHF → **5-MTHF** (active methylfolate), which then donates its methyl group to convert homocysteine → methionine.

The **MTHFR C677T** SNP (very common — ~40% of people have one copy) reduces enzyme efficiency by 30–70%, impairing the folate → methylation pathway. These individuals often benefit from **5-MTHF** (methylfolate) supplementation rather than folic acid.

## ⚙️ 6. Protein Methylation (Histones)

Beyond DNA, methylation occurs on **histone proteins** (which DNA wraps around):

- **Histone methyltransferases (HMTs)** add methyl groups to specific lysine or arginine residues on histone tails
- Effect depends on *which* residue is methylated and *how many* methyl groups:
  - H3K4me3 → gene **activation**
  - H3K27me3 → gene **repression**
  - H3K9me3 → **heterochromatin** formation

This is another major layer of epigenetic control.

## 🧪 7. RNA Methylation (Epitranscriptomics)

A newer, rapidly emerging field — methylation of RNA:

- **m6A (N6-methyladenosine)** — the most common RNA modification; regulates mRNA stability, translation, and splicing
- Written by **"writers"** (METTL3/14), read by **"readers"** (YTHDF proteins), erased by **"erasers"** (FTO, ALKBH5)
- Dysregulated in cancers, metabolic disease, and neurological conditions

## ⚠️ Consequences of Methylation Dysfunction

**Undermethylation** (too little):
- Depression, OCD, anxiety (low serotonin)
- Autoimmune conditions
- Elevated homocysteine → cardiovascular risk, blood clots, stroke
- Impaired detoxification → toxin accumulation

**Overmethylation** (too much):
- Anxiety, paranoia, low motivation
- Histamine intolerance
- Can suppress genes that should be active

## 📊 Clinical Testing

| Test | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Plasma homocysteine | Overall methylation capacity |
| MTHFR genotyping | Genetic methylation risk |
| Whole blood histamine | Methylation status (low = overmethylator) |
| SAM:SAH ratio | Direct methylation adequacy |
| Methylmalonic acid | Functional B12 status |
| Organic acids | Folate/B12 functional deficiency |

## Summary

Methylation is a **master regulator** of biology — it controls which genes are on or off, how your brain chemicals are balanced, how efficiently you detoxify, and how resilient your cells are. It's not a single pathway but a **metabolic network** interconnected through the methionine cycle, folate cycle, and transsulfuration pathway. Nutrients (B12, folate, B6, choline), genetics (MTHFR, COMT), and lifestyle (diet, stress, toxins) all profoundly influence methylation capacity.
