# Glutathione Pathway

## Overview

Glutathione (GSH) is often called the **"master antioxidant"** of the cell. It is a tripeptide — glutamate–cysteine–glycine — present in virtually all mammalian cells in millimolar concentrations, highest in the liver (5–10 mM). It is central to both Phase II conjugation (glutathione-S-transferases) and the direct neutralisation of reactive oxygen species.

## Structure and Properties

```
γ-Glu — Cys — Gly
           |
           SH  ← thiol group (reactive)
```

- **Reduced form (GSH)**: Active antioxidant; has a free –SH group
- **Oxidised form (GSSG)**: Glutathione disulfide; two GSH molecules joined by S–S bond
- The **GSH:GSSG ratio** reflects cellular redox status (healthy ratio > 100:1 in liver)

## Biosynthesis

### Step 1 — γ-Glutamylcysteine Synthesis
- **Enzyme**: Glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), also called γ-GCS
- **Reaction**: Glutamate + Cysteine + ATP → γ-Glutamylcysteine + ADP + Pi
- **Rate-limiting step**: Cysteine availability is the primary constraint
- **Regulation**: Feedback-inhibited by GSH; upregulated by Nrf2 transcription factor

### Step 2 — GSH Synthesis
- **Enzyme**: Glutathione synthetase (GSS)
- **Reaction**: γ-Glutamylcysteine + Glycine + ATP → GSH + ADP + Pi

### Substrate Availability

| Amino Acid | Primary Dietary Sources |
|---|---|
| **Cysteine** (rate-limiting) | Eggs, poultry, meat, dairy, NAC (supplement), whey protein |
| **Glutamate** | Ubiquitous; glutamine → glutamate (abundant) |
| **Glycine** | Collagen-rich foods, bone broth, gelatin, glycine supplement |

## The Glutathione Cycle (Redox Recycling)

```
2 GSH  +  H₂O₂  ─── GPx (selenium) ───→  GSSG  +  2 H₂O
                                               │
                                     Glutathione reductase
                                      (requires NADPH, FAD/B2)
                                               │
                                           2 GSH  ←──────
```

### Key Enzymes

| Enzyme | Function | Cofactor |
|---|---|---|
| **Glutathione peroxidase (GPx)** (GPx1–8) | Reduces H₂O₂ and lipid peroxides; converts 2 GSH → GSSG | Selenium (selenocysteine) |
| **Glutathione reductase (GR)** | Regenerates GSH from GSSG | NADPH (from B2/FAD, Niacin/NADPH) |
| **Glutaredoxin (Grx)** | Reduces protein mixed disulfides using GSH | — |
| **Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR)** | Parallel antioxidant system | Selenium, NADPH |

If GSSG cannot be reduced (e.g., selenium or B2 deficiency), GSSG accumulates → exported from cell → net GSH depletion.

## Glutathione-S-Transferases (GSTs) — Phase II Role

GSTs catalyse the conjugation of GSH to a wide range of electrophilic substrates:

```
GSH  +  Electrophile (R–X)  ──→  GS–R  +  HX
```

The resulting **glutathione conjugate** is processed:
1. GSH conjugate transported out (MRP1/2)
2. **γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)** cleaves glutamate → cysteinylglycine conjugate
3. Dipeptidase cleaves glycine → cysteine conjugate
4. **N-acetyltransferase** acetylates → **mercapturic acid** (excreted in urine)

### GST Isoforms and Their Substrates

| Isoform Family | Key Substrates |
|---|---|
| **GSTA** (alpha) | Steroid hormones, lipid peroxidation products (4-HNE, acrolein) |
| **GSTM** (mu) | Aromatic hydrocarbons (benzypyrene epoxides), aflatoxin |
| **GSTP** (pi) | Chemotherapy agents (cisplatin, doxorubicin) — overexpressed in many cancers → drug resistance |
| **GSTT** (theta) | Halogenated compounds, ethylene oxide |

### Genetic Null Variants

- **GSTM1 null** (~50% of Europeans): Complete absence of GSTM1 → reduced clearance of PAHs, aflatoxin, benzene
- **GSTT1 null** (~20% Europeans, ~50% East Asians): Reduced clearance of small haloalkanes
- Double null (both GSTM1 + GSTT1) significantly increases xenobiotic burden

## Nrf2 — The Master Regulator of GSH and Antioxidant Genes

**Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)** is the key transcription factor that upregulates the antioxidant response element (ARE), inducing expression of:

- GCL (GSH synthesis enzymes)
- GSTs
- NQO1 (quinone oxidoreductase)
- Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)
- Thioredoxin
- Ferritin

### Natural Nrf2 Activators

| Compound | Source |
|---|---|
| **Sulforaphane** | Cruciferous vegetables (highest in broccoli sprouts) |
| **Curcumin** | Turmeric |
| **Resveratrol** | Grapes, red wine |
| **EGCG** | Green tea |
| **Quercetin** | Apples, onions, capers |
| **Lipoic acid (ALA)** | Meat, organ meats; supplement |
| **Lycopene** | Tomatoes, cooked > raw |
| **Baicalein** | Scutellaria (Chinese skullcap) |

Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered by **Keap1** and targeted for ubiquitin-proteosomal degradation. Electrophiles and oxidants modify Keap1 cysteines → Nrf2 released → nuclear translocation → ARE gene activation.

## GSH Across the Body

| Tissue | GSH Concentration | Key Role |
|---|---|---|
| Liver | 5–10 mM | Phase II conjugation, antioxidant defence |
| Red blood cells | 2 mM | Prevents oxidative haemolysis (via GPx/GR) |
| Lungs | 100–500 µM | Protects alveolar cells from inhaled toxins, ozone |
| Mitochondria | 10–15% total GSH | Critical for mitochondrial redox balance |
| Brain | 1–3 mM | Neuronal protection; low GSH in Parkinson's disease |
| Gut epithelium | Moderate | First-pass detox and mucosal barrier protection |

## Causes of GSH Depletion

| Factor | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Acetaminophen overdose | NAPQI (Phase I metabolite) rapidly depletes hepatic GSH |
| Chronic alcohol | Impairs GSH synthesis; displaces GSH from mitochondria |
| Malnutrition (cysteine, glycine deficiency) | Substrate limitation |
| Selenium deficiency | GPx cannot regenerate GSH from GSSG |
| Riboflavin (B2) deficiency | GR cannot reduce GSSG |
| Ageing | Progressive decline in GCL activity |
| Oxidative stress / chronic illness | Consumption exceeds synthesis rate |
| Heavy metal exposure | Mercury and arsenic bind –SH groups; deplete GSH |
| HIV / sepsis | Massive ROS → GSH depletion |

## Supplementation Strategies

| Approach | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **N-acetylcysteine (NAC)** | Strong | Replenishes cysteine; used IV for paracetamol poisoning; increases GSH in liver, lungs |
| **Liposomal GSH** | Moderate | Better absorption than unprotected oral GSH; some hepatic uptake |
| **Whey protein** | Moderate | Rich in cysteine and γ-glutamylcysteine peptides; raises blood GSH |
| **Glycine** | Moderate | Rate-limiting in elderly (cysteine less limiting) |
| **Alpha-lipoic acid** | Moderate | Independently scavenges ROS; regenerates GSH from GSSG |
| **Selenium** | Essential | GPx activity requires selenocysteine |
| **Vitamin C** | Supportive | Spares GSH by directly scavenging radicals; regenerates tocopherol |
| **Undenatured oral GSH** | Poor | Rapidly hydrolysed in gut to amino acids before absorption |
