# Heavy Metal Detoxification

## Overview

Heavy metals are dense metallic elements that can accumulate in biological tissues and cause significant toxicity. Unlike organic xenobiotics, they **cannot be metabolised** (chemically broken down) — they can only be transformed between oxidation states or chelated and excreted intact.

The body manages heavy metal burden through:
1. **Metallothionein** — metal-binding proteins that sequester and buffer metals
2. **Glutathione conjugation** — GSH coordinates metals for export
3. **Methylation** (arsenic only) — changes speciation and solubility
4. **Chelation** — endogenous or exogenous ligands bind metals → urinary/biliary excretion

## The Four Most Clinically Significant Heavy Metals

### 1. Mercury (Hg)

#### Forms

| Form | Main Source | Organ Targeting |
|---|---|---|
| Elemental Hg (Hg⁰) | Dental amalgam vapour, broken thermometers | CNS (lipophilic, crosses BBB) |
| Inorganic Hg²⁺ | Industrial exposure, some skin-lightening creams | Kidneys (proximal tubule) |
| Methylmercury (MeHg) | Large fatty fish (tuna, shark, swordfish, tilefish) | CNS, foetal brain |

#### Mechanism of Toxicity

- **Binds to thiol (–SH) groups** on enzymes, structural proteins, and glutathione
- Inhibits glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, Na/K-ATPase
- Displaces zinc and selenium from metalloenzymes
- Neurotoxic: disrupts microtubule assembly, induces excitotoxicity (NMDA receptor sensitisation)

#### Detoxification Mechanisms

```
MeHg  →  demethylation in gut/liver  →  Hg²⁺
                                              │
               ┌──────────────────────────────┤
               │                              │
         GSH conjugation              Metallothionein sequestration
         (Hg–SG complex)                (MT-Hg; especially kidney)
               │
               ▼
        Biliary excretion → faeces (major route for organic forms)
        Urinary excretion → urine (minor; inorganic forms)
```

**Selenium** protects against mercury by:
- Forming inert Hg–Se complexes (HgSe, tiemannite) → trapped in tissues (not excreted but inactivated)
- High seafood selenium:mercury ratios (e.g., most tuna) suggest protective effect

#### Testing

- **Acute exposure**: Blood mercury (half-life ~70 days for inorganic; ~50 days for MeHg)
- **Chronic exposure**: Urine mercury (inorganic); hair mercury (MeHg — 1 cm = ~1 month)
- Normal: blood < 5 µg/L; urine < 5 µg/g creatinine

### 2. Lead (Pb)

#### Sources

- Historical: leaded petrol (phased out), lead paint (pre-1978 in USA)
- Current: lead pipes and plumbing solder, imported ceramics, some cosmetics, contaminated soil near smelters, imported herbal supplements
- Occupational: battery manufacturing, radiator repair, shooting ranges

#### Mechanism of Toxicity

- Mimics calcium, zinc, and iron at biological binding sites
- Inhibits ALAD (aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase) → disrupts haem synthesis → anaemia
- Inhibits NMDA receptors and voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels → neurotoxicity
- Inhibits ferrochelatase → iron not inserted into protoporphyrin → elevated blood FEP

#### Storage and Redistribution

```
Blood (half-life ~35 days)
→ Soft tissue (half-life few weeks)
→ Bone (half-life 10–20 years) ← 95% of body lead burden stored here
```

Bone dissolution during pregnancy, lactation, osteoporosis, or calcium deficiency can remobilise lead.

#### Detoxification and Chelation

| Chelator | Route | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| **EDTA** (CaNa₂-EDTA) | IV or IM | Used in acute/severe lead poisoning; mobilises bone lead |
| **DMSA** (succimer, meso-2,3-DMSA) | Oral | First-line for children; removes blood and soft tissue lead |
| **Penicillamine** | Oral | Second-line; more side-effect prone |
| **DMPS** | IV or oral (Europe) | Also chelates mercury |

**Nutritional support (preventive/adjunctive):**
- Calcium, zinc, iron compete with lead at absorption — adequate status is protective
- Vitamin C supports ALAD enzyme; may reduce lead retention (limited data)
- Pectin and other soluble fibres bind lead in gut

#### Reference Values

| Level | Classification |
|---|---|
| < 3.5 µg/dL | Below CDC reference value (UK: < 10 µg/dL action level) |
| 5 µg/dL | CDC level of concern in children |
| > 45 µg/dL | Chelation therapy indicated in children |
| > 70 µg/dL | Medical emergency |

### 3. Arsenic (As)

#### Sources

- Contaminated groundwater (Bangladesh, parts of India, Chile, Argentina)
- Rice (bioaccumulates inorganic arsenic)
- Seafood (mainly organic arsenobetaine — much less toxic)
- Treated timber (CCA, chromated copper arsenate — legacy exposure)
- Coal combustion fly ash

#### Speciation and Methylation

Arsenic undergoes **reductive methylation** in the liver — a Phase II-like detox step:

```
As⁵⁺ (arsenate)  →  As³⁺ (arsenite)  →  MMA (monomethylarsonic acid)  →  DMA (dimethylarsinic acid)
                 [GSTO1A reductase]   [AS3MT + SAM]                    [AS3MT + SAM]
                                      ← requires glutathione at each step →
```

- **DMA** is the primary urinary form (~60–80% of total arsenic in urine)
- Individuals with *AS3MT* (arsenic methyltransferase) variants or low GSH have more MMA — which is **more toxic** than DMA

#### Mechanism of Toxicity

- Binds vicinal dithiols (Cys–Cys pairs) → inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
- Substitutes for phosphate (arsenate) in ATP synthesis
- Epigenetic effects: alters DNA methylation patterns
- Carcinogen (Group 1, IARC): skin, lung, bladder, kidney cancers

#### Protection and Detoxification

| Approach | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Folate, B12, SAM | Methyl groups for AS3MT-mediated methylation → DMA |
| Glutathione (NAC, whey) | Required at every methylation step |
| Selenium | Increases arsenic methylation rate; forms inert As–Se complexes |
| Zinc | Induces metallothionein; competes at absorption |
| DMSA (succimer) | Chelates arsenic; used in acute poisoning |

### 4. Cadmium (Cd)

#### Sources

- Cigarette smoke (tobacco accumulates cadmium from soil — smokers have 3–5× higher body burden)
- Contaminated soil near smelters, phosphate fertilisers
- Certain foods: shellfish (oysters especially), organ meats, some leafy vegetables on contaminated soil
- Rechargeable batteries (NiCd)

#### Mechanism of Toxicity

- **Kidneys**: Proximal tubular damage ("Itai-itai disease" — Japan; cadmium-induced osteoporosis + renal failure)
- Binds metallothionein in liver → Cd–MT complex → delivered to kidney → kidney accumulates Cd–MT
- Inhibits calcium, zinc, and iron absorption (competes at DMT-1 transporter)
- Endocrine disruptor: agonises oestrogen receptor

#### Metallothionein (MT) and Cadmium

Metallothionein (MT-1, MT-2) are cysteine-rich proteins (~20 cysteines in 61 residues) that bind up to 7 divalent metal ions per molecule. They are induced by:
- Heavy metals (Cd, Zn, Cu, Hg)
- Glucocorticoids
- Cytokines
- Oxidative stress

MT binding limits free metal toxicity but prolongs retention; cadmium half-life in the liver is **~10–30 years**.

#### Reference Values

- Urine cadmium < 1 µg/g creatinine (below action level in most guidelines)
- Blood cadmium: < 0.5 µg/L (non-smokers)

## General Heavy Metal Detoxification Support

| Nutrient / Strategy | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Glutathione / NAC** | Chelation partner for mercury, arsenic; replenishes depleted GSH |
| **Selenium** | Forms metal–selenium complexes; GPx protection against ROS |
| **Zinc** | Induces MT synthesis; competes with Cd and Pb at absorption |
| **Vitamin C** | Antioxidant; mild chelating activity; lowers blood lead in some studies |
| **Alpha-lipoic acid** | Chelates mercury and arsenic (crosses BBB); regenerates GSH |
| **Chlorella** | Marine algae; binds heavy metals in gut (absorption barrier) |
| **High-fibre diet** | Reduces gut transit → less time for metal reabsorption |
| **Calcium and iron** | Compete with lead and cadmium at intestinal absorption sites |
| **Medical chelation (DMSA, DMPS, EDTA)** | Prescribed; required for significant toxicity; must be administered by clinicians |
