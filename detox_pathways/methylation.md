# Methylation — The One-Carbon Cycle

## Overview

Methylation is a universal biochemical reaction in which a **methyl group (–CH₃)** is transferred from **S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)** to a target molecule, altering its activity, solubility, or stability. It is essential for detoxification of hormones, neurotransmitters, and heavy metals, and underpins DNA and histone epigenetic regulation.

> Methylation is not exclusively a detox pathway — it is one of the most fundamental cellular regulatory mechanisms. It is covered here in the context of detoxification.

### Key Steps

| Enzyme | Function | Cofactors |
|---|---|---|
| **MAT** (methionine adenosyltransferase) | Converts methionine → SAM | ATP, Mg²⁺ |
| **MTHFR** | Converts 5,10-methyleneTHF → 5-MTHF (active folate) | Riboflavin (FAD) |
| **MTR** (methionine synthase) | Remethylates homocysteine → methionine | Methylcobalamin (B12), 5-MTHF |
| **MTRR** | Regenerates methyl-B12 (keeps MTR active) | Riboflavin |
| **CBS** (cystathionine β-synthase) | Diverts homocysteine → transsulfuration | Pyridoxal-5-phosphate (B6) |
| **BHMT** | Alternative remethylation using betaine (liver, kidney only) | Betaine (trimethylglycine) |

## Detoxification Roles of Methylation

### Catecholamine and Oestrogen Metabolism (COMT)

**Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)** inactivates:
- Dopamine → 3-methoxytyramine
- Adrenaline → metanephrine
- Noradrenaline → normetanephrine
- **2-OH and 4-OH oestrogen catechols → methoxy-oestrogens** (less genotoxic)

> The *COMT V158M* SNP (rs4680) reduces enzyme activity by ~40% in Met/Met homozygotes, lengthening oestrogen catechol half-life and potentially increasing breast cancer risk.

### Heavy Metal Methylation

Arsenic undergoes **reductive methylation** in the liver:
- Arsenate (As⁵⁺) → arsenite (As³⁺) → monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) → dimethylarsinic acid (DMA)
- Methylated forms are less toxic and more water-soluble → excreted in urine
- Requires: SAM + glutathione

Mercury:
- Inorganic Hg²⁺ can be methylated by gut bacteria → methylmercury (MORE toxic)
- Hepatic demethylation (minor) → inorganic form → biliary excretion

### Histamine Inactivation (HNMT)

**Histamine N-methyltransferase** converts histamine → N-methylhistamine (inactive) inside cells, primarily in the CNS, lungs, and liver. Impaired HNMT (via genetic variant or SAM depletion) contributes to histamine intolerance.

## MTHFR Gene Variants

**MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase)** is the most studied methylation gene variant in clinical nutrition:

| Variant | Frequency | Effect on enzyme |
|---|---|---|
| C677T (rs1801133) — T/T homozygous | ~10% general population, up to 20% Italians/Mexicans | ~70% reduced MTHFR activity, elevated homocysteine |
| A1298C (rs1801131) | ~10% | ~40% reduced activity (compound het with C677T = significant impairment) |

**Consequences of impaired MTHFR:**
- Reduced 5-MTHF → reduced SAM → reduced methylation capacity across all pathways
- Elevated homocysteine → endothelial damage, thrombosis risk
- Impaired DNA methylation → epigenetic dysregulation
- Increased susceptibility to oestrogen-dominant conditions

**Management**:
- Supplement with **L-methylfolate** (5-MTHF) — bypasses the MTHFR block
- Methylcobalamin (methyl-B12) rather than cyanocobalamin
- Riboflavin (B2) — stabilises thermolabile MTHFR enzyme
- Avoid high-dose synthetic folic acid (may compete with 5-MTHF at receptors)

## Homocysteine

Homocysteine is the pivotal intersection of the methylation cycle. Elevated homocysteine (>10 µmol/L) is both a marker of methylation insufficiency and an independent cardiovascular risk factor.

### Causes of Elevated Homocysteine

| Cause | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Folate deficiency | Insufficient 5-MTHF for MTR remethylation |
| B12 deficiency | MTR requires methylcobalamin |
| B6 deficiency | CBS transsulfuration requires PLP |
| Riboflavin deficiency | MTHFR needs FAD |
| MTHFR C677T T/T | Reduced 5-MTHF production |
| Renal insufficiency | Reduced homocysteine clearance |
| Hypothyroidism | Reduced MTR activity |
| Ageing | Progressive decline in methylation capacity |

### Reference Ranges

| Level | Category |
|---|---|
| < 7 µmol/L | Optimal |
| 7–10 µmol/L | Borderline |
| 10–15 µmol/L | Mild hyperhomocysteinaemia |
| > 15 µmol/L | Moderate-severe (significant cardiovascular/cognitive risk) |

## SAM — The Universal Methyl Donor

SAM is consumed in every methylation reaction and must be continuously regenerated via the folate–methionine cycle. SAM is also involved in:
- Synthesis of creatine (40% of SAM consumption)
- Synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) from PE
- Synthesis of polyamines (spermine, spermidine)
- Melatonin synthesis (ASMT enzyme)

**SAM depletion** impairs all downstream methylation, including Phase II detoxification of oestrogens, catecholamines, and heavy metals.
