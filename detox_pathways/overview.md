# Detoxification Pathways — Overview

## What Is Detoxification?

Detoxification is the body's intrinsic, multi-organ process of transforming and eliminating endogenous waste products (hormones, bilirubin, ammonia) and exogenous xenobiotics (drugs, environmental toxins, food contaminants, alcohol). Far from being a marketing term, detox is a set of rigorously characterised biochemical reactions shared across virtually all living organisms.

> **Key insight** — "Detox" is *not* a product. It is a continuous biological function performed primarily by the liver, with support from the kidneys, lungs, gut, skin, and lymphatic system.

## Primary Organs Involved

| Organ | Primary Role |
|---|---|
| **Liver** | Phase I & II biotransformation of nearly all xenobiotics |
| **Kidneys** | Filtration and urinary excretion of water-soluble conjugates |
| **Gut / Intestines** | First-pass metabolism, Phase III efflux transporters, gut microbiome transformation |
| **Lungs** | Exhalation of volatile compounds (e.g., acetone, ethanol vapour) |
| **Skin** | Minor sweating of some heavy metals and BPA |
| **Lymphatic system** | Immune-mediated removal of cellular debris and pathogens |

## The Three-Phase Model

Hepatic detoxification is classically described in three phases:

```
Lipophilic toxin
      │
      ▼
 [Phase I] Oxidation / Reduction / Hydrolysis  ──── CYP450 enzymes
      │  (adds reactive functional group)
      │  ⚠ May create MORE reactive / toxic intermediate
      ▼
 [Phase II] Conjugation  ──── GSTs, UGTs, SULTs, NATs, COMT, MAT
      │  (adds large polar group → water-soluble)
      ▼
 [Phase III] Transport & Excretion  ──── MRP2, P-gp, BCRP
      │  (moves conjugates out of cells into bile or urine)
      ▼
Eliminated via faeces or urine
```

### Why All Three Phases Must Be Balanced

Phase I generates reactive intermediates. If Phase II is overwhelmed or nutrient-deficient, these intermediates accumulate and cause oxidative DNA damage. A diet rich in Phase II inducers (e.g., cruciferous vegetables) without adequate Phase I support can create "functional blocks."

## Supporting Pathways & Systems

Beyond the classical hepatic phases, several additional systems contribute:

| Pathway | Location | Key Function |
|---|---|---|
| **Methylation** | Liver, brain, all cells | Inactivates hormones, neurotransmitters, heavy metals |
| **Sulfation** | Liver, gut, adrenals | Conjugates hormones, phenols, neurotransmitters |
| **Glucuronidation** | Liver, intestinal wall | Largest Phase II pathway by volume |
| **Glutathione conjugation** | Liver, kidneys, lungs | Neutralises reactive electrophiles and free radicals |
| **Amino acid conjugation** | Liver, kidneys | Glycine, taurine, glutamine bind bile acids and benzoates |
| **Acetylation** | Liver, lungs, spleen | Metabolises drugs (e.g., isoniazid, sulfonamides) |
