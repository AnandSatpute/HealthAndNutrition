# Resveratrol

## Overview
Resveratrol is a **stilbene polyphenol** produced by plants as a **phytoalexin** — a defence compound synthesised in response to infection, UV radiation, and injury. It was first isolated from the roots of *Veratrum grandiflorum* in 1939 and gained widespread scientific attention in 1997 when it was shown to inhibit cancer cell growth in multiple models. Resveratrol became the centrepiece of the "**French paradox**" hypothesis — the low cardiac mortality in southern France despite a high-saturated-fat diet was attributed in part to red wine consumption and its resveratrol content. However, epidemiological evidence linking resveratrol *intake* to health outcomes in humans is weak, and most dramatic mechanistic findings come from in vitro and animal studies using pharmacological doses. Human clinical trials with resveratrol have had **mixed and generally modest results**.

- **Classification:** Stilbene polyphenol; phytoalexin (plant defence compound)
- **Chemical forms:** *trans*-Resveratrol (active, more stable); *cis*-Resveratrol (less active); resveratrol glucoside = **piceid** (most abundant form in wine/grapes)
- **Key targets:** SIRT1 (sirtuin 1), AMPK, NF-κB, COX-1/2, Nrf2, estrogen receptor β (ERβ), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)
- **Bioavailability challenge:** Rapidly metabolised and conjugated in gut wall and liver → very short half-life (~1 h); only ~1% reaches systemic circulation as free *trans*-resveratrol; most circulates as sulfate/glucuronide conjugates

## Mechanisms of Action

| Target | Effect |
|---|---|
| **SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1)** | Resveratrol activates SIRT1 (NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase) → deacetylates PGC-1α → increases mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, gluconeogenesis; FOXO3a deacetylation → stress resistance and autophagy; debate persists whether resveratrol activates SIRT1 directly or indirectly via AMPK |
| **AMPK** | Activates AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) → mimics caloric restriction; increases glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation; inhibits mTOR → reduced anabolism, promotes autophagy |
| **NF-κB** | Inhibits NF-κB activation → reduces pro-inflammatory gene expression (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, COX-2, iNOS) |
| **COX-1/2 (cyclooxygenase)** | Inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 at high concentrations → reduces prostaglandin synthesis; anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet effects |
| **Nrf2** | Activates Nrf2 → upregulates glutathione synthesis, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), catalase, SOD — broad antioxidant gene induction |
| **Estrogen receptor β (ERβ)** | Phytoestrogen activity — binds ERβ > ERα; may have protective effects in ER-positive breast cancer (controversial) |
| **p53 activation** | Activates p53 tumour suppressor in cancer cell lines → apoptosis; demonstrated extensively in vitro |

## Dietary Sources

| Source | Resveratrol content |
|---|---|
| Red wine | 0.2–14 mg/L (highly variable; *trans*-resveratrol + piceid combined) |
| Grape juice (red/purple) | 0.4–2.0 mg/L |
| Grapes (red skin) | 0.16–3.54 mg/100 g skin |
| Peanuts (raw) | 0.01–0.26 mg/100 g |
| Peanut butter | 0.04–0.13 mg/100 g |
| Japanese knotweed root (*Polygonum cuspidatum*) | Most concentrated natural source; basis for most commercial resveratrol supplements (10–20% resveratrol extract) |
| Blueberries | 0.01–0.36 mg/100 g |
| Dark chocolate (cocoa) | Trace amounts |

> A typical glass of red wine contains ~1–3 mg *trans*-resveratrol. Most RCTs showing biological effects used **150–1,000 mg/day** — 50–1,000× more than found in a glass of wine. The "French paradox" resveratrol intake explanation is biochemically implausible at dietary doses; overall Mediterranean lifestyle factors are better explanations.

## Metabolism and Bioavailability

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | *trans*-Resveratrol absorbed rapidly in small intestine; piceid (glucoside) hydrolysed by intestinal β-glucosidase → *trans*-resveratrol then absorbed |
| **First-pass metabolism** | Rapid conjugation in gut wall (sulfation, glucuronidation) and liver; only ~1% of oral dose reaches circulation as free (unconjugated) *trans*-resveratrol |
| **Plasma forms** | Resveratrol-3-O-sulfate and resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide are the dominant plasma species; biological activity of conjugates vs. free resveratrol is debated |
| **Half-life** | ~1 hour (free resveratrol); ~4–9 hours (conjugates) |
| **Gut microbiome metabolism** | Colonic bacteria produce dihydroresveratrol and other metabolites; some metabolites (e.g., lunularin) may have biological activity; the gut microbiome significantly shapes resveratrol's effective dose |
| **Strategies to improve bioavailability** | Micronized resveratrol (40-fold increase in Cmax); nanoparticle encapsulation; liposomal formulations; piperine co-administration (inhibits UGT enzymes) |

## Clinical Evidence in Humans

| Condition | Evidence Summary |
|---|---|
| **Cardiovascular risk factors** | Mixed; some trials show modest reductions in blood pressure (systolic −3 to −5 mmHg), LDL-C oxidation, platelet aggregation at doses ≥500 mg/day; no robust primary CVD outcome data |
| **Type 2 diabetes / insulin sensitivity** | Several RCTs show improved insulin sensitivity, fasting glucose, and HbA1c at 150–500 mg/day; meta-analyses show modest benefit; not yet clinically recommended |
| **Cognitive / Alzheimer's** | COGNIAGE/REVIDA trials: no significant cognitive benefit vs placebo; one trial showed resveratrol slowed CSF biomarker changes in MCI |
| **Cancer prevention** | Promising in vitro and animal; no human RCT evidence of cancer prevention or treatment benefit; not recommended clinically |
| **Longevity / caloric restriction mimetic** | CALERIE and RESMENA trials: mixed; resveratrol activates SIRT1/AMPK in some studies; does not robustly replicate caloric restriction metabolic benefits in healthy humans |
| **PCOS** | Promising signal: 1,500 mg/day for 3 months reduced total testosterone and DHEAS, improved insulin sensitivity in a small RCT (n=30) |
| **Bone health** | RESHAW trial: 75 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improved bone turnover markers in postmenopausal women; small trial |

## Clinical Relevance

### The "Resveratrol Hype" vs Reality
- The initial explosion of interest stemmed from SIRT1-longevity work in yeast and mice. A key paper (Howitz et al., 2003, *Nature*) suggested resveratrol was a STAC (SIRT1-activating compound). Subsequent work showed the SIRT1 activation was partly a fluorescent assay artefact (Kaeberlein et al., 2005). David Sinclair and associates continued to report benefits, but an independent replication effort found most mouse longevity effects required pharmacological levels.
- **Bottom line:** Resveratrol has real biological targets and modest measurable effects in human trials at doses >150 mg/day, but the "longevity elixir" narrative is not supported by current human clinical evidence.

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Anticoagulants (warfarin, aspirin)** | Resveratrol inhibits COX-1 → anti-platelet effect; may potentiate anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy → bleeding risk; monitor with warfarin use |
| **Cytochrome P450 (CYP450)** | Inhibits CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 → may increase plasma levels of drugs metabolised by these enzymes (warfarin, statins, some antidepressants, immunosuppressants) at high doses |
| **Quercetin** | Synergistic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects; co-found in many polyphenol-rich foods; quercetin may inhibit UGT conjugation of resveratrol → increases resveratrol bioavailability |
| **Piperine (black pepper)** | Inhibits UGT and sulfotransferase activity → significantly increases resveratrol bioavailability |
| **Oestrogens / hormone-sensitive cancers** | Phytoestrogenic activity via ERβ — theoretical concern in ER+ breast cancer; clinical significance at food doses is negligible; high-dose supplementation caution warranted in hormone-sensitive cancers |
| **Metformin** | Both activate AMPK; potentially additive effects on insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function; resveratrol + metformin studied in T2DM; no significant interactions reported |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Dose:** Most human trials use **150–1,000 mg/day** *trans*-resveratrol; no established RDA or UL
- **Form:** *trans*-Resveratrol is the biologically active isomer; typically derived from *Polygonum cuspidatum* (Japanese knotweed); avoid *cis*-resveratrol-dominant products
- **Bioavailability strategies:** Micronized resveratrol, liposomal formulations, or products including piperine (5–20 mg) for enhanced absorption
- **Timing:** No established optimal timing; with meals improves tolerability; some data suggest absorption is not significantly affected by food
- **Safety:** Well tolerated up to 1,000 mg/day; occasional GI side effects (nausea, diarrhoea) at higher doses; **>2,500 mg/day** associated with GI intolerance in some subjects; no significant toxicity in human trials up to 5,000 mg/day over 29 days (only pharmacokinetic study)
- **Who to avoid:** Individuals on warfarin, CYP3A4-metabolised drugs, or hormone-sensitive cancers should use caution and consult a physician
- **Overall assessment:** Evidence suggests modest benefits for metabolic health markers at doses >150 mg/day; insufficient evidence to recommend for disease treatment; relatively safe as a supplement; dietary sources (red wine, grapes) do not provide pharmacologically relevant doses
