# Glutathione

## Overview
Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant intracellular antioxidant in the human body, present in virtually every cell at millimolar concentrations. It is a **tripeptide** — γ-L-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-glycine — synthesised endogenously from three amino acids. Unlike dietary antioxidants, glutathione is **not an essential nutrient**: the body synthesises it continuously, making cellular GSH levels a product of substrate availability (particularly cysteine), enzyme capacity, and oxidative burden. GSH is the hub of the antioxidant network: it directly neutralises reactive oxygen species (ROS), regenerates vitamins C and E, powers the glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase enzyme families, and mediates detoxification of drugs, xenobiotics, and heavy metals.

- **Type:** Endogenous tripeptide antioxidant; non-essential (synthesised de novo)
- **Structure:** γ-Glu–Cys–Gly; the unusual γ-peptide bond (glutamate linked via its γ-carboxyl) protects GSH from non-specific peptidases
- **Active form:** Reduced glutathione (GSH); oxidised form: GSSG (glutathione disulfide)
- **Key property:** The thiol (–SH) group of cysteine is the reactive centre — donates electrons to neutralise ROS → forms GSSG; GSSG is reduced back to 2×GSH by glutathione reductase (GR) using NADPH

## Biosynthesis

| Step | Enzyme | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Step 1** | γ-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCL; rate-limiting) | Glutamate + Cysteine → γ-Glutamylcysteine; **rate-limited by cysteine availability and feedback-inhibited by GSH** |
| **Step 2** | Glutathione synthetase (GS) | γ-Glutamylcysteine + Glycine → **GSH (reduced glutathione)** |

- GCL is the committed, rate-limiting enzyme; cysteine is the limiting amino acid substrate
- **Nrf2 pathway:** Oxidative stress activates Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) → binds ARE (antioxidant response element) → upregulates GCL, GS, glutathione reductase, thioredoxin — the master regulator of the cellular antioxidant response
- **N-acetylcysteine (NAC)** is the primary clinical means of replenishing GSH — NAC → cysteine → feeds GCL

## Functions

- **Direct ROS scavenging:** GSH + H₂O₂ → GSSG + 2H₂O (via glutathione peroxidase, GPx); neutralises lipid hydroperoxides, peroxynitrite, hydroxyl radicals
- **Regeneration of vitamins C and E:** Vitamin C (dehydroascorbate) → ascorbate (via DHAR, using GSH); Vitamin E radical → Vitamin E (via Vitamin C, which GSH regenerates) — GSH is the electron donor at the base of the antioxidant hierarchy
- **Xenobiotic and drug detoxification (Phase II):** Glutathione S-transferase (GST) conjugates GSH to electrophilic compounds → glutathione conjugate → excreted via bile/urine (mercapturic acid pathway); substrates include paracetamol (NAPQI), heavy metals (arsenic, mercury), carcinogens
- **Amino acid transport (γ-glutamyl cycle):** γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) transfers the glutamyl group of GSH to amino acids at the cell membrane → facilitates amino acid uptake; GGT is elevated in liver disease and alcohol excess (diagnostic marker)
- **Protein thiol protection (S-glutathionylation):** GSH forms mixed disulfides with protein cysteines during oxidative stress (S-glutathionylation) → protects thiol groups from irreversible oxidation; reversed by glutaredoxins
- **Leukotriene synthesis:** LTC4 synthase conjugates GSH to LTA4 → leukotriene C4 (LTC4) — a potent bronchoconstrictive eicosanoid; connects GSH to inflammatory signalling
- **DNA synthesis:** Ribonucleotide reductase (requires a glutaredoxin/GSH system) reduces ribonucleotides → deoxyribonucleotides; essential for DNA synthesis and repair
- **Mitochondrial antioxidant defence:** Mitochondrial GSH pool (mGSH) is separate and particularly critical — mitochondria produce ~90% of cellular ROS; mGSH depletion is closely linked to apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **GSH utilisation** | GPx (glutathione peroxidase) uses GSH to reduce H₂O₂ and lipid hydroperoxides → GSSG |
| **GSSG reduction** | Glutathione reductase (GR) + NADPH → 2× GSH; NADPH supplied by G6PD (pentose phosphate pathway) |
| **GSH degradation** | GGT on extracellular cell surfaces cleaves GSH → CysGly + glutamate; dipeptidase cleaves CysGly → Cys + Gly; amino acids recycled via γ-glutamyl cycle |
| **Kidney filtering** | Plasma GSH is primarily filtered and degraded by kidney tubular GGT; liver is the primary GSH exporter to plasma |
| **GSH:GSSG ratio** | Healthy cells maintain >99% GSH (ratio ~100:1 to 300:1); under significant oxidative stress this falls; ratio is a clinical marker of redox status |

## Food Sources and Dietary Influences

Glutathione itself is **poorly absorbed intact** from food — gut brush-border peptidases hydrolyse it; however dietary GSH in food may contribute to intestinal epithelial GSH and hepatic GSH via cysteine supply.

| Factor | Effect on Cellular GSH |
|---|---|
| **N-acetylcysteine (NAC)** | Most reliable means of raising cellular GSH — provides cysteine bypassing the rate-limiting GCL step |
| **Whey protein** | Highest dietary cysteine source (as cysteine + cystine); RCTs show whey protein raises lymphocyte GSH |
| **Cruciferous vegetables** | Glucosinolates → sulforaphane → activates Nrf2 → upregulates GCL and GS expression → raises cellular GSH capacity |
| **Alpha-lipoic acid** | Recycles GSSG → GSH; replenishes NADPH; raises GSH indirectly |
| **Selenium** | Cofactor for all **GPx enzymes** (GPx1–4, GPx6) — selenium deficiency reduces GPx activity → impairs GSH utilisation even if GSH levels are adequate |
| **Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)** | FAD cofactor for glutathione reductase (GR) — B2 deficiency reduces GSSG → GSH recycling |
| **Dietary GSH (food)** | Asparagus, avocado, spinach, okra are highest food sources; bioavailability remains debated |
| **Oral GSH supplements** | Liposomal GSH shows improved bioavailability vs conventional oral GSH (limited trial evidence); sublingual GSH may also be better absorbed |

## Clinical Relevance

### Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) Overdose
- Paracetamol overdose is the prototypical GSH depletion injury: normal doses are detoxified by glucuronidation/sulfation (~90%); ~5% is oxidised by CYP2E1/CYP3A4 → **NAPQI** (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, highly reactive)
- Normal GSH conjugates NAPQI → mercapturic acid → safe excretion; in overdose, GSH is depleted faster than it can be replenished → NAPQI covalently binds hepatic proteins → centrilobular necrosis
- **NAC is the antidote** — provides cysteine to rapidly replenish GSH; most effective within 8–10 hours of ingestion

### Oxidative Stress Diseases
- Decreased GSH:GSSG ratios found in: HIV/AIDS, sepsis, ARDS, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, COPD, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ALS
- Whether GSH depletion is causal or consequential varies by condition

### Haemolytic Anaemia (G6PD Deficiency)
- G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency impairs pentose phosphate pathway → **NADPH deficiency** → glutathione reductase cannot recycle GSSG → GSH depletion → RBC oxidative damage → haemolysis
- Triggers: primaquine, dapsone, fava beans, infection; common in Mediterranean, African, Southeast Asian populations (protects against malaria)

### Liver Disease
- The liver is the primary GSH synthesis organ; hepatic GSH is critical for Phase II detoxification
- Alcoholic liver disease: ethanol → acetaldehyde (CYP2E1; NAD⁺/NADH shift) → oxidative stress → GSH depletion; alcohol also specifically depletes **mitochondrial GSH** (mGSH) by impairing mitochondrial GSH transport
- NAC, SAMe (S-adenosylmethionine), silymarin (milk thistle) may partially support hepatic GSH in liver disease

### Cystic Fibrosis
- CF airways have depleted GSH due to impaired CFTR-mediated GSH secretion (CFTR transports GSH across epithelial membranes); oxidative stress in CF airways drives disease progression
- Inhaled GSH has been studied in CF (small trials — some symptomatic benefit)

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Selenium** | Essential cofactor for all GPx enzymes; GSH is ineffective without selenium-activated GPx; selenium deficiency → impaired GSH peroxidase activity |
| **Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)** | FAD cofactor for GR; B2 deficiency → GSSG accumulates → GSH:GSSG ratio falls |
| **Vitamin C** | Regenerated by GSH (DHAR); synergistic antioxidant cycle: GSH→C→E→direct ROS quenching; vitamin C also spares GSH |
| **Vitamin E** | Tocopheryl radical → regenerated by vitamin C → regenerated by GSH; fat-soluble ROS neutralisation depends on GSH |
| **Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA)** | Recycles GSH; raises intracellular cysteine via Nrf2 activation; also reduces GSSG via dihydrolipoate; strong synergy |
| **NAC (N-acetylcysteine)** | Bypasses rate-limiting GCL step → directly replenishes cysteine → raises GSH; used clinically in paracetamol overdose, contrast nephropathy prevention, COPD |
| **Alcohol** | Depletes hepatic and mitochondrial GSH; promotes oxidative stress via CYP2E1 induction |
| **Nrf2 activators** | Sulforaphane (cruciferous veg), curcumin, resveratrol activate Nrf2 → upregulate GCL, GS, GR expression → increase GSH synthesis capacity |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Oral reduced glutathione (GSH):** Historically poor bioavailability (GI tract hydrolysis); **liposomal GSH** (250–500 mg/day) shows better plasma and lymphocyte GSH elevation in small RCTs; sublingual delivery also studied
- **N-acetylcysteine (NAC) — most evidence-based:** 600–1,800 mg/day; raises tissue GSH; approved for paracetamol overdose (IV) and as mucolytic in COPD; studied in COVID-19, PCOS, psychiatric conditions (OCD, bipolar), fertility
- **Whey protein (30–40 g/day):** Richest dietary cysteine source; several RCTs demonstrate raised lymphocyte and plasma GSH in elderly and HIV patients
- **Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA; 300–600 mg/day):** Raises GSH via Nrf2 and GSSG reduction; used in diabetic neuropathy, metabolic syndrome; crosses blood-brain barrier — brain GSH support
- **Selenium (55–200 µg/day):** Required for GPx activity; selenium supplementation in deficient individuals restores GPx activity and improves GSH utilisation
- **Silymarin (milk thistle; 420 mg/day standardised extract):** Hepatoprotective; raises hepatic GSH in animal models; some clinical evidence in alcoholic liver disease and NAFLD
