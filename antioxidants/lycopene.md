# Lycopene

## Overview
Lycopene is a **bright red carotenoid pigment** responsible for the characteristic colour of tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruit, and guava. It is an **acyclic carotene** (no β-ionone ring), which distinguishes it structurally from β-carotene and renders it **unable to be converted to vitamin A** — making its health effects entirely independent of vitamin A activity. Lycopene is the most potent singlet oxygen quencher among all dietary carotenoids (2× β-carotene, 10× α-tocopherol), making it an exceptionally effective antioxidant. Lycopene accumulates preferentially in the testes, adrenal glands, and liver. Its most studied clinical association is with **prostate cancer risk reduction**, supported by epidemiological data, though large intervention trials have been mixed.

- **Classification:** Acyclic carotenoid; fat-soluble antioxidant; no vitamin A activity (no β-ionone ring)
- **Structure:** 40-carbon polyene with 11 conjugated double bonds (record among common carotenoids); highly unsaturated structure confers exceptional singlet oxygen quenching
- **Forms:** All-*trans*-lycopene (predominant in raw tomatoes); *cis*-lycopene (5*-cis*, 9*-cis*, 13*-cis*) — processing increases *cis* content; *cis*-lycopene has better bioavailability than *trans*
- **Key property:** Processing (heating, homogenising, puréeing) dramatically increases bioavailability of lycopene from tomatoes — making tomato paste/sauce more bioavailable than raw tomatoes

## Functions

- **Singlet oxygen (¹O₂) quenching:** Lycopene's conjugated double bond system makes it the most efficient singlet oxygen quencher of dietary carotenoids — physically dissipates the excitation energy of ¹O₂ → returns to ground state without being consumed; the carotenoid is regenerated (unlike vitamin C or E which are consumed)
- **Peroxyl radical scavenging:** Lycopene interrupts lipid peroxidation chain reactions in cell membranes and LDL particles
- **LDL oxidation protection:** Lycopene incorporated into LDL reduces its susceptibility to oxidative modification → potentially reduces atherogenic ox-LDL formation
- **Cell growth regulation:** Inhibits cancer cell proliferation via gap junction communication enhancement (Cx43 connexin upregulation) → restores growth-suppressive cell-cell communication disrupted in cancer; independent of antioxidant activity
- **Androgen receptor modulation:** Downregulates androgen receptor (AR) signalling in prostate cells → potentially reduces prostate cell proliferation driven by androgens
- **IGF-1 pathway inhibition:** Lycopene reduces IGF-1 receptor signalling (a growth driver in prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers)
- **Phase II enzyme induction:** Activates Nrf2 → induces glutathione S-transferase, NQO1, heme oxygenase-1 → cellular antioxidant and detoxification capacity enhancement

## Metabolism and Bioavailability

| Factor | Effect on Bioavailability |
|---|---|
| **Heating / processing** | Increases lycopene bioavailability: disrupts plant cell walls, releases lycopene from chromoplasts, isomerises *trans* → *cis* (more bioavailable); tomato paste/sauce → 5× higher plasma response vs raw tomato |
| **Dietary fat co-ingestion** | Fat is required: lycopene is incorporated into micelles via bile salts; adding olive oil to tomato sauce dramatically increases lycopene absorption (cook with oil) |
| **Food matrix** | Fine particle size (homogenisation, blending) and cooking increase bioaccessibility; whole tomato < blended tomato < tomato paste |
| **Cholesterol-lowering drugs (cholestyramine, ezetimibe)** | May impair carotenoid absorption (bile acid sequestrants impair micelle formation) |
| **Absorption** | Absorbed in small intestine in micelles → incorporated into chylomicrons → lymph → plasma → distributed to tissues |
| **Plasma distribution** | LDL (37%), HDL (14%), VLDL (14%), other lipoproteins; plasma lycopene is an excellent biomarker of tomato intake |
| **Tissue accumulation** | Testes (~4.3 nmol/g wet tissue), adrenal glands, liver — highest tissue concentrations; prostate accumulates significant lycopene |
| **Half-life** | ~12–33 days in plasma |

## Dietary Sources

| Food | Serving | Lycopene (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Tomato paste | 2 tbsp (30 g) | 9.5–14 mg |
| Tomato sauce (canned) | 100 mL | 15–21 mg |
| Tomatoes (raw) | 1 medium (123 g) | 3.2 mg |
| Tomato juice | 240 mL | 22 mg |
| Ketchup | 1 tbsp (15 g) | 2.5 mg |
| Watermelon | 1 cup (154 g) | 12.7 mg |
| Pink grapefruit | ½ fruit | 1.5–3 mg |
| Guava (red flesh) | 100 g | 5.2 mg |
| Papaya (pink) | 100 g | 1.8 mg |

> **Cooking tip:** Adding olive oil when making tomato sauce increases lycopene absorption by 2–3× vs. oil-free preparation. Tomato paste is the most concentrated and bioavailable source. Watermelon provides lycopene with excellent bioavailability (already high *cis*-lycopene content, high water activity aids absorption).

## Clinical Relevance

### Prostate Cancer
- The most extensively studied association: epidemiological data (Harvard NHS cohort, >40,000 men) shows highest lycopene intake associated with ~21–35% lower risk of prostate cancer, particularly aggressive/advanced prostate cancer
- Lycopene accumulates in the prostate; men with prostate cancer have lower prostate lycopene than controls
- **Mechanisms:** AR downregulation, IGF-1 inhibition, cell cycle arrest (G₀/G₁), gap junction restoration, antioxidant protection of DNA
- **Intervention trials: mixed.** Several small RCTs show reduced PSA or improved histological outcomes; SELECT trial (selenium+vitamin E) found no benefit but did not test lycopene; definitive large RCT lacking
- **WCRF/AICR:** "Limited, suggestive evidence" for lycopene and prostate cancer — cannot make a firm recommendation based on current evidence

### Cardiovascular Disease
- Plasma lycopene is inversely associated with carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, in multiple cross-sectional studies
- Lycopene inhibits HMG-CoA reductase (modestly) → may contribute to cholesterol lowering
- **LYRIS trial** (2019): 7 mg lycopene/day for 2 months in patients with CVD → significantly improved brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD, a marker of endothelial function) vs placebo

### Skin Photoprotection
- Lycopene in skin provides modest UV protection — acts as an endogenous sunscreen; higher skin lycopene levels → less UV-induced erythema
- Tomato paste (40 g/day; ~16 mg lycopene) for 10 weeks significantly reduced UV-induced skin erythema vs olive oil control
- Does not replace topical sunscreen (SPF effect is minor) but complements it

### Fertility (Male)
- Testes have the highest lycopene concentration of any tissue; oxidative stress is a major driver of male infertility
- Small RCTs suggest lycopene supplementation improves sperm count, motility, and morphology in oligospermic men; a systematic review confirmed modest benefit

### Hypertension
- Meta-analysis: lycopene supplementation (>12 mg/day in studies) modestly reduced systolic BP (~5 mmHg) vs placebo; effect appears threshold-dependent (above ~25 mg/day of dietary intake)

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Fat-soluble antioxidants (β-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin)** | Carotenoids compete for intestinal absorption (shared SR-BI and CD36 transporters); very high supplemental β-carotene may reduce lycopene absorption and vice versa |
| **Cholesterol-lowering drugs** | Bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, colestipol) impair fat-soluble compound absorption including lycopene; ezetimibe (NPC1L1 inhibitor) may reduce carotenoid absorption |
| **Dietary fat** | Required for lycopene absorption (micelle formation); advise consumption of lycopene-rich foods with healthy fats (olive oil, avocado) |
| **Phytosterol supplements** | May reduce carotenoid absorption at high doses (shared micellar solubilisation pathway) |
| **Anticoagulants** | At very high doses, lycopene may have mild anti-platelet effects — clinically insignificant at food intake levels |
| **Finasteride/dutasteride (5-ARIs)** | Combined with prostate cancer-protective lifestyle including lycopene — no drug interaction data, but 5-ARIs and lycopene may complementarily reduce prostate cancer risk |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Dietary approach preferred:** Processed tomato products (paste, sauce, juice) with olive oil are the most effective means of achieving high lycopene bioavailability — no need for supplements in most people
- **Supplemental dose:** 10–30 mg/day *trans*-lycopene or mixed isomers used in most RCTs; natural extracts (tomato oleoresin containing mixed isomers) may be preferable to pure *all-trans*-lycopene
- **No RDA/AI established** — no official dietary reference intake for lycopene in most countries
- **Safety:** No UL established; no toxicity at supplemental doses; lycopene does not cause hypervitaminosis A (no provitamin A activity); high intake may cause **lycopenodermia** (orange skin discolouration) — harmless and reversible
- **Important note:** Unlike β-carotene (which caused harm in smokers in ATBC and CARET trials), lycopene supplementation has **not** been associated with adverse effects in smokers; the absence of provitamin A activity may account for this safety difference
- **Absorption optimisation:** Take with a fat-containing meal; choose *cis*-lycopene-rich sources (cooked/processed tomatoes) or supplements containing mixed lycopene isomers
