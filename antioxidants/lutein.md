# Lutein

## Overview
Lutein is a **xanthophyll carotenoid** — a yellow-orange oxygenated carotene found in high concentrations in leafy green vegetables, egg yolks, and marigold flowers. Unlike beta-carotene, lutein **has no provitamin A activity**. Its most critical biological role is in the **eye**: lutein is selectively concentrated in the macula lutea of the retina (hence the name — *lutea* = yellow in Latin), where it and its stereoisomer zeaxanthin form the **macular pigment** that acts as a natural short-wavelength (blue-violet) light filter and antioxidant shield for the photoreceptors. Lutein is the subject of intense research for **age-related macular degeneration (AMD)** prevention and management — the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in adults over 65.

- **Classification:** Xanthophyll carotenoid (dihydroxy carotenoid); fat-soluble; no provitamin A activity
- **Structure:** 40-carbon carotenoid with two hydroxyl (–OH) groups; ε-ring at both ends; stereoisomer of zeaxanthin (differs in double bond position in one ring)
- **Macular pigment optical density (MPOD):** Measurable biomarker of macular lutein/zeaxanthin content; low MPOD = risk factor for AMD
- **Key tissues:** Macula (highest density of any tissue in body), lens, brain, skin

## Functions

- **Blue light filtering (macular pigment):** Lutein and zeaxanthin in the macula absorb high-energy blue-violet light (400–500 nm) before it reaches the photoreceptors — acts as a biological internal UV filter; reduces photochemical damage to the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
- **Singlet oxygen and ROS quenching in the retina:** The macula is metabolically hyperactive and exposed to high photon flux → very high local ROS generation; lutein quenches ¹O₂, lipid peroxyl radicals, and peroxynitrite in the highly unsaturated photoreceptor outer segment membranes (rich in DHA)
- **Lens antioxidant protection:** Lutein in the crystalline lens reduces photochemical oxidative damage → protective against nuclear cataract formation
- **Neuroprotection (brain):** Lutein is the most predominant carotenoid in the human brain (particularly in the frontal lobe, occipital cortex, cerebellum); associated with faster neural processing speed in observational studies; mechanism: membrane antioxidant protection, DHA conservation, anti-neuroinflammation
- **Skin photoprotection:** Lutein in skin absorbs UV-visible light → protects against UV-induced oxidative damage and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation (collagen degradation)
- **Anti-inflammatory signalling:** Lutein reduces NF-κB activation and inhibits COX-2 expression → reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) in vitro and in several animal models

## Metabolism and Bioavailability

| Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Dietary fat co-ingestion** | Essential for lutein absorption (micellar solubilisation); an egg (with yolk fat) has better lutein bioavailability than spinach alone — fat in the egg yolk drives absorption |
| **Egg yolk vs. vegetables** | Egg yolk lutein has ~3–5× higher bioavailability than lutein from dark leafy greens (spinach, kale) despite vegetables having more total lutein — due to protein-binding of lutein in chloroplasts; xanthophylls in eggs are in free (unbound) form in lipid droplets |
| **Cooking** | Moderate heating improves lutein bioavailability from vegetables (breaks down cell walls and protein complexes); overcooking destroys it |
| **Absorption** | SR-BI (scavenger receptor BI) and CD36 at enterocyte brush border mediate carotenoid uptake → incorporated into chylomicrons → lymph |
| **Plasma transport** | HDL is the primary plasma carrier of lutein (different from lycopene/β-carotene which preferentially associate with LDL) |
| **Retinal accumulation** | Lutein is selectively accumulated in the macula by GSTP1 (glutathione S-transferase Pi 1) — a lutein-binding protein that concentrates it from blood; meso-zeaxanthin in the fovea is derived from lutein conversion in situ by RPE |
| **Half-life** | Long plasma half-life (~10–20 days); tissue (retinal) half-life much longer; MPOD increases are sustained after supplementation stops |

| Spinach (raw) | 1 cup (30 g) | 3.7 mg |
| Collard greens (cooked) | 1 cup (170 g) | 14.6 mg |
| Broccoli (cooked) | 1 cup (91 g) | 2.0 mg |
| Peas (cooked) | 1 cup (160 g) | 4.1 mg |
| Corn (cooked) | 1 cup (154 g) | 2.2 mg |
| Egg yolk | 1 large | 0.25 mg (but 3–5× more bioavailable than vegetable sources) |
| Orange pepper | 1 medium | 1.0 mg |
| Pistachios | 28 g | 0.8 mg |

## Clinical Relevance

### Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
- AMD is the leading cause of blindness in adults >65; characterised by progressive degeneration of the macular photoreceptors and RPE; two forms: dry (geographic atrophy) and wet (neovascular)
- **AREDS2 trial** (n=4,203): supplementation with 10 mg lutein + 2 mg zeaxanthin replaced β-carotene in the AREDS formula → **18% reduction in risk of AMD progression** to advanced AMD; lutein/zeaxanthin superior to β-carotene (which had concerns in smokers); now the standard of care recommendation for intermediate AMD
- **Mechanism:** Restores MPOD; protects photoreceptor membranes and RPE from oxidative and phototoxic damage
- Low MPOD is an independent risk factor for AMD; MPOD can be measured clinically (heterochromatic flicker photometry)

### Cataract
- Population studies (Nurses' Health Study, n=77,000+): highest quintile of dietary lutein+zeaxanthin intake associated with ~19–22% reduced risk of nuclear cataract
- Lutein in the lens absorbs UV and reduces photochemical cross-linking of lens proteins (the basis of nuclear cataract)

### Cognitive Function
- Lutein is the most abundant carotenoid in the human brain; brain lutein correlates with crystallised intelligence and processing speed in multiple cross-sectional studies (infants, adults, older adults)
- **COGNI-SUN RCT:** Lutein supplementation improved cognitive performance in healthy older women; mechanism likely via membrane antioxidant protection and anti-neuroinflammation

### Skin
- Oral lutein (10 mg/day) increases skin hydration, elasticity, and photoprotection against UV-induced erythema in RCTs; combination with topical lutein is synergistic

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Zeaxanthin** | Zeaxanthin is the co-pigment of the macula; lutein predominates in the peripheral macula, zeaxanthin in the central fovea; the two are synergistic and always measured together (MPOD reflects both) |
| **DHA (Omega-3)** | DHA is the dominant fatty acid in photoreceptor outer segment membranes; lutein protects DHA from peroxidation; DHA+lutein supplementation shows additive benefits for AMD and MPOD vs. either alone |
| **Vitamin E** | Both are lipid-soluble antioxidants protecting membrane PUFAs; synergistic in retinal membranes |
| **Beta-carotene** | Competes with lutein for intestinal absorption via shared SR-BI transporter; high-dose beta-carotene supplementation may reduce plasma lutein; AREDS2 replaced beta-carotene with lutein+zeaxanthin partly for this reason |
| **Dietary fat** | Required for absorption; low-fat diets or fat malabsorption significantly reduces lutein bioavailability |
| **Smoking** | Smoking depletes plasma lutein and zeaxanthin; smokers at higher risk of AMD; smoking × low lutein status = interactive risk |

## Supplementation Notes
- **AREDS2 dose:** 10 mg lutein + 2 mg zeaxanthin per day — evidence-based for intermediate AMD (AREDS2 RCT); this is the clinical standard
- **General eye health:** 6–20 mg/day lutein commonly used; 2 mg/day zeaxanthin; increases MPOD over 3–12 months
- **Sources:** Marigold flower extract (*Tagetes erecta*) is the primary commercial source; FloraGLO (DSM) and OmniXan are the major branded standardised forms used in research
- **Form:** Free lutein (as in egg yolk) vs. lutein esters (in supplements from marigold extracts); lutein esters must be hydrolysed in the gut; both have similar bioavailability when taken with fat
- **Safety:** No UL established; no adverse effects reported up to 20 mg/day in RCTs; no provitamin A activity — cannot cause hypervitaminosis A; no adverse effects in smokers (unlike beta-carotene)
- **Dietary note:** Eating eggs with leafy greens dramatically increases lutein absorption from greens — clinical-level dietary optimisation strategy
