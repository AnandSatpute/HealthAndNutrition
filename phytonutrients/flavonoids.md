# Flavonoids

## Overview
Flavonoids are the **largest and most studied class of plant polyphenols**, with over 6,000 identified compounds. They share a common C₆–C₃–C₆ diphenylpropane skeleton consisting of two aromatic rings (A and B) connected by a three-carbon bridge that forms an oxygenated heterocyclic ring (C ring). Minor variations in the C ring structure, hydroxylation pattern, and glycosylation determine which of the six main subclasses a compound belongs to. Flavonoids are ubiquitous in plant foods and are a major component of the average human diet — estimated dietary intake ranges from ~200 mg/day to >1 g/day depending on diet composition. They exert their effects primarily via antioxidant activity, enzymatic inhibition, receptor modulation, and modulation of the gut microbiome.

**Six major subclasses:**

| Subclass | Characteristic | Key Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Flavonols** | Most widely distributed; C3-OH (3-hydroxyflavone backbone) | Quercetin, Kaempferol, Myricetin, Fisetin |
| **Flavones** | Lack C3-OH; often methylated or polymethoxylated | Luteolin, Apigenin, Chrysin, Tangeretin |
| **Flavanones** | Saturated C2–C3 bond; characteristic of citrus | Hesperidin, Naringenin, Eriocitrin |
| **Flavan-3-ols** | No C4 ketone; most complex structural diversity | Catechin, Epicatechin, EGCG (green tea), Proanthocyanidins |
| **Anthocyanins** | Water-soluble pigments (red/purple/blue); pH-sensitive | Cyanidin, Delphinidin, Pelargonidin |
| **Isoflavones** | B ring attached at C3 (isomeric to flavones); phytoestrogenic | Genistein, Daidzein, Glycitein, Puerarin |

## Functions

- **Antioxidant and radical scavenging:** Donate hydrogen atoms (HAT mechanism) or electrons (SET mechanism) to neutralise ROS; chelate transition metals (Fe²⁺, Cu²⁺) to prevent Fenton reaction; inhibit xanthine oxidase and NADPH oxidase (superoxide sources)
- **Anti-inflammatory:** Inhibit NF-κB → reduce TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β; inhibit COX-1/COX-2 and 5-LOX → reduce prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis; luteolin, quercetin, and apigenin are particularly potent NF-κB inhibitors
- **Estrogenic / anti-estrogenic (isoflavones):** Genistein and daidzein bind ERα and ERβ with weak affinity (~1/100–1/1000 vs oestradiol); preferential ERβ agonism → tissue-selective effects (bone and brain protective, breast anti-proliferative); act as SERMs (selective oestrogen receptor modulators)
- **Cardiovascular protection:** Improve endothelial function (via eNOS activation and NO production — quercetin, EGCG, epicatechin); inhibit platelet aggregation; reduce LDL oxidation; reduce blood pressure (flavanol-rich cocoa is among the best-evidenced)
- **Enzyme inhibition:** Inhibit CYP enzymes (grapefruit flavanones — naringenin/bergamottin inhibit CYP3A4); inhibit aromatase (chrysin, quercetin); inhibit α-glucosidase (quercetin — relevant for blood glucose)
- **Microbiome modulation:** Most dietary flavonoids reach the colon unabsorbed; colonic bacteria catabolise flavonoids → phenolic acids (e.g., urolithins from ellagitannins, equol from daidzein) with independent bioactivity; quercetin → 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid; gut microbiome composition determines individual flavonoid metabolism substantially
- **Autophagy and senescence:** Quercetin and fisetin identified as senolytics in preclinical studies — selectively clear senescent cells; EGCG and quercetin activate autophagy via AMPK/mTOR pathway
- **Neuroprotection:** Cross blood-brain barrier (lipophilic aglycones); reduce neuroinflammation; apigenin and luteolin studied in Alzheimer's and anxiety models; flavanol supplementation improves memory in older adults (COSMOS-mind trial)

## Absorption and Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Dietary forms** | Mainly as glycosides (sugar conjugates) in food; aglycones less common (except in processed foods) |
| **Small intestinal absorption** | Aglycones and some glycosides absorbed in small intestine; lactase phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) and cytosolic β-glucosidase (CBG) cleave glucose-conjugated flavonoids in enterocytes |
| **Colonic fermentation** | The majority of dietary flavonoids (particularly flavonols, flavones, flavan-3-ols) reach the colon → catabolised by *Lactobacillus*, *Bifidobacterium*, *Clostridium* → phenolic acids, valerolactones, equol |
| **Equol from isoflavones** | Daidzein → equol (by gut bacteria in ~30–50% of people, primarily those with specific *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* populations); equol has higher ERβ affinity than the parent compound; equol-producer status substantially determines soy health benefits |
| **Phase I/II metabolism** | Absorbed flavonoids → methylation (COMT), sulfation (SULT), glucuronidation (UGT) → circulate as conjugates; deconjugation may occur in tissues |
| **Bioavailability range** | Highly variable: flavanols from green tea — up to 30%; quercetin from food — ~0.4–17% depending on matrix; isoflavones — ~15–40% depending on equol-producer status |

## Clinical Relevance

### Cardiovascular Disease
- **Flavanol-rich cocoa:** Multiple RCTs demonstrate reductions in blood pressure, improved FMD (flow-mediated dilation), reduced platelet aggregation; COSMOS trial found cocoa extract (500 mg flavanols/day) associated with 27% reduction in cardiovascular death
- **Quercetin:** Meta-analyses show modest antihypertensive effect (~3–5 mmHg systolic reduction); reduces CRP and LDL oxidation in clinical trials
- **Anthocyanins:** Strong epidemiological association between berry consumption and reduced CVD risk; NHANES and UK Biobank data support; RCTs show BP and insulin sensitivity improvements

### Type 2 Diabetes
- Flavonoids inhibit α-glucosidase and α-amylase → blunted postprandial glucose; quercetin, EGCG, berberine-like flavonoids activate AMPK → improve insulin sensitivity
- Higher flavonoid intake consistently associated with lower T2D risk in prospective cohorts (Harvard NHS, EPIC)

### Cancer Prevention
- Epidemiological data: High isoflavone intake associated with lower breast cancer risk in Asian populations; mechanistically, ERβ agonism may oppose ERα-driven proliferation; evidence in Western populations is mixed
- EGCG inhibits DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase) → epigenetic reactivation of tumour suppressor genes; inhibits cancer cell proliferation in multiple in vitro models; human RCT data limited
- Apigenin and luteolin: pro-apoptotic in multiple cancer cell lines; anti-angiogenic via VEGF inhibition; being studied as sensitisers for chemotherapy

### Gut Microbiome
- Flavonoids act as prebiotics: selectively stimulate *Bifidobacterium* and *Lactobacillus*; reduce pathogenic *Firmicutes*; increase butyrate production
- Proanthocyanidins (grape seed, cranberry) associated with reduced UTI recurrence — inhibit *E. coli* adhesion to uroepithelium (A-type proanthocyanidins)

### Bone Health
- Isoflavones: genistein supplementation (54 mg/day) reduces bone resorption markers and improves BMD in postmenopausal women in several RCTs; particularly effective in equol producers; endorsed by some European menopause guidelines as an alternative to HRT for bone support
- Quercetin and kaempferol: stimulate osteoblast differentiation in cell models; associated with higher hip BMD in epidemiological studies

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **CYP3A4 (grapefruit effect)** | Furanocoumarins and flavanones in grapefruit irreversibly inhibit intestinal CYP3A4 → dramatically increase bioavailability of statins, calcium channel blockers, immunosuppressants, benzodiazepines, and many other drugs — potentially dangerous |
| **Iron absorption** | Quercetin and other flavonols chelate non-haem iron → reduce iron absorption (relevant in iron-deficient individuals); black tea reduces iron absorption by up to 60% at a meal |
| **Thyroid hormones (isoflavones)** | Genistein inhibits thyroid peroxidase → may impair thyroid hormone synthesis; clinically significant mainly in iodine deficiency or hypothyroid patients taking levothyroxine (separate dosing by 4 hours recommended) |
| **HRT / SERM drugs** | Isoflavones have weak estrogenic activity → theoretical additive effect with HRT; clinically mild but worth noting in hormone-sensitive conditions |
| **Warfarin** | Quercetin is a CYP2C9 inhibitor → may raise warfarin levels; high-dose quercetin supplements warrant INR monitoring; dietary levels unlikely to be significant |
| **Equol producer status** | Microbiome composition determines conversion of daidzein → equol; this status significantly affects health outcomes of soy-based isoflavones |
| **Biotin (high-dose EGCG)** | High-dose EGCG can falsely lower biotin lab values in immunoassay-based tests (cross-reactivity) |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Quercetin (500–1,000 mg/day):** Most studied flavonoid supplement; poor oral bioavailability — phytosome (quercetin-lecithin) or quercetin with bromelain improves absorption; used for immunomodulation, antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory effects; senolytic protocols use 1,000 mg/day pulsed with dasatinib (experimental)
- **EGCG / Green tea extract (400–800 mg EGCG/day):** Evidence for LDL reduction, modest weight loss, and insulin sensitivity; high doses (>800 mg EGCG/day) associated with rare hepatotoxicity — do not take on an empty stomach; adulterated products have caused liver injury
- **Isoflavones (40–100 mg/day total isoflavones from soy):** Support for menopausal symptom relief (modest hot flush reduction vs placebo) and bone density in postmenopausal women; response varies by equol-producer status
- **Anthocyanins (from blueberry extract or standardised berry concentrates):** Doses around 320 mg/day studied for cognition and cardiovascular outcomes; well-tolerated; limited standardisation of commercial products
- **Proanthocyanidins / OPC (grape seed extract 100–300 mg/day):** Used for venous insufficiency, capillary fragility, oedema; evidence for blood pressure reduction; well-tolerated
- **Fisetin (100–500 mg/day):** Emerging senolytic; accumulates in brain after oral dosing; studied in preclinical models of neurodegeneration and longevity; limited but promising human data
