# Carotenoids

## Overview
Carotenoids are a family of **over 700 naturally occurring fat-soluble pigments** synthesised by plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria — responsible for the red, orange, and yellow colours of many fruits and vegetables. Humans cannot synthesise carotenoids de novo; all carotenoids must be obtained from the diet. They are divided into two major groups: **carotenes** (pure hydrocarbons: α-carotene, β-carotene, lycopene) and **xanthophylls** (oxygenated carotenoids: lutein, zeaxanthin, astaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, canthaxanthin). A subset — the **provitamin A carotenoids** (β-carotene, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin) — can be cleaved by intestinal BCMO1 (β-carotene 15,15ʹ-monooxygenase) to yield retinal → retinol (Vitamin A). Non-provitamin A carotenoids (lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin, astaxanthin) have independent antioxidant and signalling roles.

- **Type:** Fat-soluble phytonutrients (terpenoids; 8 isoprene units = C₄₀ skeleton)
- **Key members:** β-carotene, α-carotene, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, astaxanthin
- **Tissue accumulation:** Stored in adipose tissue, liver, adrenal glands; lutein/zeaxanthin concentrate in the retinal macula; lycopene concentrates in prostate, testes, adrenal glands
- **Absorption factor:** Must be consumed *with fat* — micellar formation is required; absorption ranges from 5–65% depending on food matrix, fat co-ingestion, and cooking

## Functions

| Function | Details |
|---|---|
| **Provitamin A activity** | β-Carotene, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin → cleaved to retinal by BCMO1; retinal → retinol (Vit A) or retinoic acid; essential for vision, immunity, epithelial integrity, embryogenesis |
| **Singlet oxygen quenching** | Carotenoids are uniquely efficient at quenching singlet oxygen (¹O₂) — the characteristic excited-state ROS produced by UV radiation in skin and retina; they dissipate singlet oxygen energy as heat via their conjugated double-bond system |
| **Peroxyl radical scavenging** | Act as chain-breaking antioxidants in lipid bilayers — particularly effective at low partial pressures of oxygen (tissues, not blood) |
| **Blue light filtration** | Lutein and zeaxanthin form the macular pigment optical density (MPOD) — physically absorbs blue light (400–500 nm) before it reaches photoreceptors, reducing photodamage |
| **Cell signalling** | Carotenoid metabolites (apo-carotenoids, retinoids) bind nuclear receptors (RXR, RAR) → regulate gene expression; independent of provitamin A activity |
| **Gap junction communication** | β-Carotene and lycopene upregulate connexin-43 expression → increase gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) → associated with anti-cancer effects in cell studies |
| **Immune modulation** | Enhance NK cell activity, lymphocyte proliferation; β-carotene supplementation in deficiency states improves cell-mediated immunity |

## Absorption and Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Digestion** | Carotenoids are released from food matrix by chewing and cooking; heat and mechanical disruption break protein-carotenoid complexes → improves bioavailability (cooked tomato > raw for lycopene) |
| **Micellar incorporation** | Require dietary fat for incorporation into mixed micelles in the small intestine; SR-BI and CD36 are the primary intestinal uptake transporters |
| **Intestinal conversion** | BCMO1 cleaves provitamin A carotenoids symmetrically → 2× retinal; BCDO2 catalyses eccentric cleavage → apo-carotenals (less studied) |
| **Transport** | Packaged into chylomicrons → thoracic duct → systemic circulation → LDL and HDL; transferred to peripheral tissues via lipoprotein lipase |
| **Storage** | Accumulate in adipose, liver; lutein/zeaxanthin selectively transported and concentrated in the retina by the GSTP1 protein (zeaxanthin-binding protein) |
| **BCMO1 polymorphisms** | Up to 45% of people carry BCMO1 variants (e.g., R267S, A379V) reducing conversion efficiency by 30–70% → higher dietary requirement for preformed Vitamin A |

## Dietary Sources

| Carotenoid | Best Food Sources |
|---|---|
| **β-Carotene** | Sweet potato, carrots, pumpkin, butternut squash, cantaloupe, kale, spinach |
| **α-Carotene** | Carrots, pumpkin, butternut squash |
| **Lycopene** | Cooked tomatoes (tomato paste, sauce), watermelon, guava, pink grapefruit, papaya |
| **Lutein** | Kale, spinach, collard greens, Swiss chard, egg yolk |
| **Zeaxanthin** | Corn, kale, orange peppers, egg yolk |
| **β-Cryptoxanthin** | Papaya, tangerines, orange peppers, pumpkin |
| **Astaxanthin** | Wild salmon, krill, shrimp, microalgae (*Haematococcus pluvialis*) |

> **Key principle:** Bioavailability from cooked and processed foods is often greater than from raw foods; fat co-ingestion (even small amounts) is essential.

## Clinical Relevance

### Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
- AREDS and AREDS2 trials: Lutein (10 mg) + Zeaxanthin (2 mg) supplementation reduced progression from intermediate to advanced AMD by ~25%; replaced β-carotene in AREDS2 after smokers on supplemental β-carotene showed increased lung cancer risk
- Macular pigment (lutein + zeaxanthin) correlates with MPOD, which is protective against photodamage-driven AMD

### Carotenoids and Cancer Prevention
- **Lycopene:** Epidemiological association with reduced prostate cancer risk; inhibits IGF-1 signalling and induces cell cycle arrest in vitro; RCTs have not consistently confirmed benefit
- **β-Carotene and lung cancer (smokers):** ATBC and CARET trials showed high-dose supplemental β-carotene (20–30 mg/day) *increased* lung cancer risk in heavy smokers — likely due to pro-oxidant metabolites (β-carotene + smoke oxidants → reactive breakdown products); **dietary carotenoids are not associated with this risk**
- **General diet:** High dietary carotenoid intake consistently associated with reduced cancer risk across cohort studies; confounding with overall diet quality is a concern

### Cardiovascular Disease
- Higher red blood cell / plasma carotenoid levels associated with lower CVD risk and all-cause mortality in large epidemiological studies
- Mechanistically: antioxidant protection of LDL, reducing LDL oxidation; anti-inflammatory effects via NF-κB suppression (lycopene, astaxanthin)

### Vitamin A Deficiency
- In resource-limited settings, dietary carotenoids (especially β-carotene from orange and yellow vegetables) are the primary vitamin A source
- WHO recommendation: high-dose vitamin A supplementation for deficient children; **β-carotene supplements are NOT equivalent to preformed Vitamin A** due to conversion variability

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Dietary fat** | Essential for absorption; avocado, olive oil, or eggs as co-ingested fat significantly increases carotenoid bioavailability from salads |
| **Vitamin E** | Synergistic antioxidant; vitamin E regenerates oxidised carotenoids in lipid membranes; carotenoids spare vitamin E |
| **Vitamin C** | Water-soluble cycle: vitamin C reduces carotenoid-derived radicals; carotenoids protect lipid phases |
| **Iron** | β-Carotene from food may enhance iron absorption in some studies; likely modest effect |
| **Colestyramine / Orlistat** | Fat absorption inhibitors reduce carotenoid absorption (fat soluble) |
| **Tobacco smoke** | Pro-oxidant environment converts β-carotene to reactive cleavage products — **supplemental β-carotene is contraindicated in smokers** |
| **Statin drugs** | No significant interaction; carotenoids may have additive LDL-oxidation protection |
| **BCMO1 variants** | SNPs in BCMO1 reduce provitamin A conversion → poor converters need preformed retinol from animal foods |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Dietary carotenoids** are the preferred and safest source — consistently associated with health benefits; supplemental forms have a more mixed evidence base
- **Lutein (10 mg/day) + Zeaxanthin (2 mg/day):** Well-supported for AMD risk reduction (AREDS2); widely available; generally safe; no established UL
- **Lycopene (15–30 mg/day):** Commonly studied dose; primarily from food (tomato products); supplements have inconsistent evidence
- **β-Carotene supplements:** Avoid high-dose supplementation in smokers or asbestos-exposed individuals; dietary sources are entirely safe
- **Astaxanthin (4–12 mg/day):** Potent antioxidant; emerging evidence for exercise recovery, skin photoprotection, and metabolic health; well-tolerated; GRAS status
- **Carotenodermia:** High dietary intake of β-carotene/lycopene → orange-yellow skin discolouration (palms, soles), especially with carrot/tomato juice overconsumption — benign and reversible; not a sign of Vitamin A toxicity
