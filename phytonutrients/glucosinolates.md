# Glucosinolates

## Overview
Glucosinolates are a class of **sulphur- and nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites** found almost exclusively in the order *Brassicales*, which includes the cruciferous vegetables: broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kale, watercress, rocket (arugula), radishes, and mustard. Over **130 individual glucosinolates** have been characterised, all sharing a core β-D-glucopyranose moiety linked via S–C bond to a sulfonated oxime, plus a highly variable R side chain derived from amino acids (methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, or other amino acids). Glucosinolates are biologically inert in intact plant cells. However, upon cell damage (chopping, chewing, cooking), they are hydrolysed by the plant enzyme **myrosinase** (β-thioglucoside glucohydrolase) — which is stored separately — releasing a suite of bioactive breakdown products: **isothiocyanates**, **nitriles**, **indoles**, and **epithionitriles**, depending on pH and cofactors. The primary health-linked compounds are the **isothiocyanates** (especially sulforaphane) and **indole-3-carbinol (I3C)** / **3,3ʹ-diindolylmethane (DIM)**.

- **Type:** Thioglucosides (non-nutrient, non-essential phytonutrient)
- **Bioactive breakdown products:** Isothiocyanates (ITCs), Indoles (I3C, DIM), Nitriles
- **Key compound:** **Sulforaphane** (SFN) — derived from glucoraphanin (via myrosinase) — the most studied ITC; highest concentrations in **broccoli sprouts** (50–100× more glucoraphanin per gram than mature broccoli)
- **Myrosinase compartmentalisation:** Plant myrosinase is destroyed by cooking; gut bacterial myrosinase (e.g., *Bacteroides*, *Lactobacillus*) converts glucosinolates → ITCs in the colon; the host's individual gut microbiome significantly affects ITC bioavailability from cooked vegetables

## Functions

| Function | Details |
|---|---|
| **Nrf2 pathway activation** | Sulforaphane and other ITCs alkylate Keap1's cysteine residues → release Nrf2 from Keap1 → Nrf2 translocates to nucleus → binds ARE → upregulates Phase II detoxification enzymes (NQO1, HO-1, GSTs, GCL, thioredoxin) and antioxidant proteins — the master anticancer and cytoprotective enzyme induction pathway |
| **Phase II detoxification** | ITCs induce NQO1 (quinone reductase), glutathione S-transferases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases → conjugation of carcinogens, mutagens, and reactive intermediates → enhanced excretion; key mechanism for cancer prevention in epidemiological studies |
| **Oestrogen metabolism modulation** | I3C → DIM (acid-catalysed dimerisation in the stomach); DIM modulates CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 → shifts oestradiol metabolism from 16α-hydroxyestradiol (more proliferative) to 2-hydroxyestradiol (less proliferative); used therapeutically in oestrogen-sensitive conditions |
| **Anti-inflammatory (NF-κB inhibition)** | Sulforaphane inhibits NF-κB activation → reduces COX-2 expression, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 production in macrophages and epithelial cells; relevant in inflammatory bowel disease and chronic inflammation |
| **Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition** | Sulforaphane and other ITCs inhibit class I and II HDACs → epigenetic gene reactivation; tumour suppressor genes silenced by HDAC-mediated chromatin compaction are reactivated — mechanistic basis for anti-cancer and anti-ageing epigenetic effects |
| **Autophagy induction** | Sulforaphane induces autophagy via AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition → cellular quality control; relevant for neurodegeneration and cancer prevention |
| **H. pylori suppression** | Sulforaphane has direct bactericidal activity against *Helicobacter pylori* (including clarithromycin-resistant strains) — small clinical trials in Japan show broccoli sprout consumption reduces *H. pylori* colonisation and gastric mucosal inflammation |
| **Blood glucose regulation** | Sulforaphane activates AMPK → improves insulin sensitivity; also inhibits glucose-6-phosphatase in hepatocytes → reduces hepatic glucose output; a 2017 RCT (Axelsson et al.) showed sulforaphane reduced fasting glucose in obese T2D patients |

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Hydrolysis by myrosinase** | On cell damage, plant myrosinase cleaves the β-thioglucosidic bond → releases an unstable aglycone that spontaneously rearranges (Lossen rearrangement) → isothiocyanate (or nitrile if epithiospecifier protein is active) |
| **pH and ESP influence** | Neutral pH favours ITC production; acidic pH and epithiospecifier protein (ESP) favour nitrile formation (less bioactive) - young broccoli has less ESP → more ITCs |
| **Fate of cooked glucosinolates** | Myrosinase is heat-sensitive; lightly steamed broccoli (3 min) substantially retains bioavailability; boiling/microwaving >5 min destroys most myrosinase; cooked glucosinolates hydrolysed in colon by bacterial myrosinase |
| **Mercapturic acid pathway** | Absorbed ITCs are conjugated to glutathione (by GSTs) → cysteinylglycine conjugate → cysteine conjugate → N-acetylcysteine conjugate (mercapturic acid) → excreted in urine; urinary dithiocarbamates are validated biomarkers of ITC intake |
| **DIM formation** | I3C (from indole glucosinolates: glucobrassicin) → acid-catalysed trimerisation and dimerisation in the stomach → DIM + other oligomers; I3C itself is unstable but DIM is stable; DIM is the primary circulating metabolite |
| **Half-life** | ITCs: relatively short plasma half-life (~2–4 hours); daily or twice-daily intake recommended for sustained tissue levels |

## Dietary Sources

| Vegetable | Key Glucosinolates | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Broccoli sprouts** | Glucoraphanin (sulforaphane precursor) | 50–100× higher glucoraphanin than mature broccoli; best source |
| **Broccoli (mature)** | Glucoraphanin, glucobrassicin (indoles) | Lightly steamed preferred; raw also good |
| **Brussels sprouts** | Sinigrin, glucobrassicin | High total glucosinolate content |
| **Kale** | Gluconapoleiferin, glucobrassicin | Also rich in carotenoids |
| **Cabbage** | Sinigrin, progoitrin | Both green and red; red cabbage also rich in anthocyanins |
| **Cauliflower** | Glucoraphanin, glucobrassicin | White variety lower carotenoids but similar glucosinolates |
| **Watercress** | Gluconasturtiin (→ phenethyl ITC) | Strong ITC profile; richest PEITC source |
| **Radish** | Glucoraphasatin, glucoerucin | Raw; myrosinase intact |
| **Rocket (arugula)** | Glucoerucin (→ erucin) | Mild but consistent ITC source |
| **Mustard seeds** | Sinigrin, sinalbin | Used as condiment; high ITC potential |

> **Cooking tip:** Chop broccoli 40 minutes before cooking to allow myrosinase to act while the enzyme is still active; lightly steam (3 min) rather than boil. Alternatively, add raw mustard seeds to cooked broccoli to provide exogenous myrosinase.

## Clinical Relevance

### Cancer Prevention
- **Epidemiology:** High cruciferous vegetable intake consistently associated with reduced risk of bladder, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers in prospective cohort studies (Harvard Health Professionals, EPIC); associations are among the strongest in the plant food–cancer literature
- **Mechanism (multi-target):** Carcinogen detoxification (Phase II induction), DNA damage prevention, cell cycle arrest, pro-apoptotic effects in transformed cells, HDAC inhibition → reactivation of tumour suppressors, anti-angiogenic effects
- **Phase II ITC supplementation trials (ongoing):** Sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprout extracts in prostate cancer (EPOC trial), bladder cancer, colon polyp recurrence
- **Prostate cancer:** Broccoli-enriched diet RCT showed changes in gene expression in prostate tissue (GSTP1 pathway) favouring anti-cancer microenvironment; SFN delays progression in TRAMP mouse model

### Breast Cancer and Oestrogen Metabolism
- DIM (3,3ʹ-Diindolylmethane): Phase I/II trials show DIM (150–300 mg/day) shifts urinary oestrogen metabolite ratios toward 2-OHE₁ and away from 16α-OHE₁; being studied in women at high breast cancer risk; sold as a supplement for "oestrogen detox"
- Women on tamoxifen: I3C/DIM may interact with oestrogen metabolism; caution warranted; discuss with oncologist

### Thyroid Function — Goitrogens
- **Progoitrin** (in cabbage, Brussels sprouts, kale) → goitrin (upon hydrolysis) — inhibits thyroid peroxidase → can reduce thyroid hormone synthesis → goitre in extreme intake or iodine deficiency
- **Clinical significance:** Requires very high intake (typically >several hundred grams raw daily); cooking reduces goitrogen activity; adequate iodine intake protects; **no concern for normal mixed dietary intake**
- Patients with hypothyroidism taking medication: cook cruciferous vegetables and do not consume in extreme amounts, especially raw juices

### Type 2 Diabetes
- 2017 RCT (Axelsson, Science Translational Medicine): Concentrated broccoli sprout extract (providing ~40 µmol/day sulforaphane) in obese subjects with T2D showed significant reduction in fasting blood glucose and HbA1c; hepatic glucose production suppressed (via AMPK/G6Pase inhibition); promising but requires replication

### Autism Spectrum Disorder
- Pilot RCT (Singh 2014, PNAS): Sulforaphane (50–150 µmol/day, 18 weeks) improved social interaction, communication, and aberrant behaviour scores in young men with ASD on standardised scales; proposed mechanism: fever-response simulation via Nrf2 activation; a larger Phase 2 trial is ongoing

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Thyroid medication (levothyroxine)** | Goitrogens in raw cruciferous vegetables may impair thyroid hormone synthesis; separate large raw doses from medication; cooking largely eliminates concern |
| **CYP1A2 induction** | ITCs may induce CYP1A2 → accelerate metabolism of caffeine, clozapine, olanzapine, and other CYP1A2 substrates → potential for reduced drug levels |
| **Warfarin (Vitamin K content)** | Cruciferous vegetables are high in Vitamin K₁ → may reduce warfarin effectiveness if intake varies; encourage consistent intake rather than avoidance |
| **Iodine** | Goitrogens compete with iodine uptake at the thyroid; adequate iodine intake greatly attenuates goitrogenic effect |
| **Myrosinase sources** | Adding mustard seed to cooked cruciferous veg restores myrosinase activity → increases ITC production from cooked food |
| **Gut microbiome** | *Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron*, *Lactobacillus agilis*, and other bacteria express bacterial myrosinase → convert intact glucosinolates to ITCs in the colon; probiotic-rich gut → better ITC bioavailability from cooked cruciferous veg |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Broccoli sprout powder / extract (standardised for glucoraphanin or sulforaphane):** Most common supplement form; doses providing 10–40 µmol sulforaphane studied; quality varies widely — look for products that include active myrosinase or add a myrosinase activator; "SGS" (sulforaphane glucosinolate) is a standardised extract from broccoli sprout
- **Stabilised sulforaphane (Avmacol® and similar):** Provides both glucoraphanin and myrosinase in separate layers to prevent premature conversion; better conversion than non-standardised extracts
- **DIM (Diindolylmethane; 150–300 mg/day):** Stable, bioavailable form of the I3C metabolite; used for oestrogen metabolism support, PMS, fibrocystic breast disease, and used in integrative oncology; well-tolerated; may cause headache or transient GI effects at high doses
- **I3C (Indole-3-carbinol; 200–400 mg/day):** Less stable than DIM; converted to DIM and other oligomers in the acidic stomach; often preferring DIM for consistent dosing
- **Best dietary approach:** Daily consumption of 200–300 g of diverse cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, kale, Brussels sprouts, cabbage), with a mix of raw and lightly cooked, provides meaningful glucosinolate and ITC exposure without the need for supplementation for most purposes
