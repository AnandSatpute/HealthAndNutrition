# Pre / Intra / Post-Workout Nutrition

## Overview
Workout nutrition timing — often called **nutrient timing** — refers to the strategic consumption of macronutrients and micronutrients before, during, and after exercise to optimise performance, recovery, and adaptation. While total daily food intake remains the most important nutritional variable for long-term body composition and performance, nutrient timing provides a meaningful "second-order" benefit for athletes training at high volumes and intensities. The theoretical basis is that exercise acutely alters insulin sensitivity, muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates, glycogen storage kinetics, and hormonal milieu — all of which can be leveraged by appropriate nutrient delivery.

> **Context:** The relative importance of timing decreases as dietary quality and total intake improve. For recreational athletes eating adequate total protein and carbohydrates, precise timing is less critical than often marketed.

## Pre-Workout Nutrition

### Goals
1. Maximise glycogen stores for the session
2. Provide pre-exercise amino acids to reduce net protein catabolism
3. Enhance performance via ergogenic compounds (caffeine, creatine)
4. Prevent GI distress during training

### Macronutrient Guidelines

| Timing Before Exercise | Carbohydrates | Protein | Fat | Fluid |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **3–4 hours** | 3–4 g/kg body weight (full meal) | 0.3–0.5 g/kg | Moderate (20–40 g) | 5–7 mL/kg |
| **1–2 hours** | 1–2 g/kg (moderate meal/snack) | 0.2–0.3 g/kg | Low (<15 g) | 3–5 mL/kg |
| **<1 hour** | 0.5–1 g/kg (small snack) | 10–20 g | Low (<5 g) | 3–5 mL/kg |

### Carbohydrate Type Pre-Exercise
- **High-GI vs. low-GI:** High-GI carbohydrates 30–60 min before exercise deliver rapid glucose → slight reactive hypoglycaemia possible in sensitive individuals; most athletes are unaffected
- **Low-GI meals** 3–4 hours before sustain energy better and are recommended for endurance events
- **Glycogen full state:** Requires adequate carbohydrate intake over 24–48 hours preceding competition — single pre-race meal cannot rescue depleted glycogen

### Ergogenic Compounds
| Compound | Optimal Pre-Exercise Timing | Dose |
|---|---|---|
| **Caffeine (anhydrous tablet)** | 45–60 min before | 3–6 mg/kg |
| **Creatine** | Timing flexible; daily dose can be pre- or post-workout | 3–5 g |
| **Beta-alanine** | Not time-sensitive; any time pre- or non-workout | 3.2–6.4 g/day total |
| **Sodium bicarbonate** | 60–90 min before (with 1.5 L water to minimise GI distress) | 0.3 g/kg |
| **Beetroot juice (nitrates)** | 2–2.5 hours before (for peak nitrite conversion) | 400–500 mg nitrates |

### Practical Pre-Workout Meal Examples
- **3 hours before:** Oats + banana + eggs + orange juice (CHO: ~80 g, Protein: ~25 g)
- **1.5 hours before:** Greek yogurt + berries + granola (CHO: ~40 g, Protein: ~20 g)
- **<1 hour before:** Banana + 200 mL skimmed milk or rice cakes with honey (CHO: ~25 g, Protein: ~5 g)

## Intra-Workout Nutrition

### When Is It Necessary?
- **Sessions <60 minutes, moderate intensity:** Water only — no additional carbohydrates needed
- **Sessions 60–90 minutes, high intensity:** Small CHO intake enhances performance (mouth rinse effect also works)
- **Sessions >90 minutes:** Exogenous carbohydrates become performance-critical
- **Multi-event days / twice-daily training:** Intra-workout CHO + protein for rapid recovery between sessions

### Carbohydrate Intake Guidelines During Exercise

| Session Duration | Intra-Workout CHO Recommendation |
|---|---|
| <60 min | Not required; optional mouth rinse |
| 60–75 min | 30 g/hour (1 gel ≈ 22 g) |
| 75–90 min | 30–60 g/hour |
| >90 min | 60 g/hour (glucose alone, via SGLT1 transporter saturable at 60 g/hour) |
| >2.5 hours (high intensity) | 60–90 g/hour using **multiple transportable carbohydrates (MTC)** — glucose:fructose 2:1 ratio (or maltodextrin:fructose) avoids SGLT1 saturation via combined SGLT1 (glucose) + GLUT5 (fructose) uptake |

### Multiple Transportable Carbohydrates (MTC) Concept
- Glucose/maltodextrin uses SGLT1 transporter (saturates at ~60 g/hour)
- Fructose uses GLUT5 (separate transporter, additional 30 g/hour capacity)
- **2:1 glucose:fructose ratio** at 90 g/hour → ~20% better performance than glucose alone in >3-hour events (Currell & Jeukendrup, 2008)

### Fluid Requirements During Exercise

| Condition | Sweat Rate Estimate | Fluid Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| Moderate exercise, cool temp | 500–1000 mL/hour | Drink to thirst; water usually sufficient |
| High intensity, warm weather | 1000–2000 mL/hour | 400–800 mL/hour with electrolytes; avoid overdrinking (hyponatraemia risk) |
| Ultra-endurance events | 500–1500 mL/hour | Individualised; Na⁺ supplementation essential (500–1000 mg Na⁺/hour) |

### Electrolyte Considerations
- **Sodium (Na⁺):** 500–1000 mg/hour in prolonged exercise (>2 hours) prevents hyponatraemia; lost in sweat at ~460–1840 mg/L depending on individual
- **Potassium (K⁺):** 150–300 mg/hour (lost in sweat: 120–225 mg/L)
- **Magnesium:** Modest losses; usually replaced by post-exercise food
- Sports drinks typically contain: 400–800 mg Na⁺/L + 78–195 mg K⁺/L + 6–8% CHO

### Protein During Exercise
- Only relevant for ultra-endurance events (>4 hours) or back-to-back sessions
- Addition of protein (0.25 g/kg/hour) to CHO drink in events >4 hours may reduce muscle damage and improve subsequent performance; minimal GI effect if well-tolerated protein source used

## Post-Workout Nutrition

### The Anabolic Window — Reality vs. Myth
- Traditional view: narrow 30-minute "anabolic window" post-exercise requires immediate protein/CHO
- **Current evidence:** The window is 2–4 hours wide; urgency depends on time since last meal and session type
  - If training fasted or last meal >5 hours ago → post-workout meal timing is important
  - If training 2–3 hours after a normal meal → urgency is low; next meal within 2–4 hours is adequate
  - **Protein timing matters more than carbohydrate timing** for muscle protein synthesis (MPS)

### Protein — The Priority

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Amount** | 0.25–0.4 g/kg immediately post-exercise (typically 20–40 g for most athletes); meta-analysis (Morton et al., 2015) shows >0.4 g/kg shows no additional MPS benefit per dose |
| **Quality** | Fast-digesting, leucine-rich sources preferred (whey > casein > soy > rice for acute MPS stimulus); leucine threshold (~2–3 g leucine per dose) is the key trigger of mTORC1 activation |
| **Leucine content as guide:** Whey protein 25 g = ~2.7 g leucine; casein 25 g = ~2.3 g; soy 25 g = ~1.9 g |
| **Sources** | Whey protein isolate/concentrate, milk, eggs, chicken breast; plant-athltes: pea + rice protein blend (matched leucine) |
| **Frequency** | 4–5 protein feedings of 20–40 g throughout the day (including pre-sleep dose) > 2 large meals for daily MPS maximisation |

### Carbohydrates Post-Exercise

| Goal | CHO Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Glycogen replenishment (endurance athlete)** | 1.0–1.2 g/kg/hour for first 4 hours post-training (urgent for athletes training >2×/day); adding protein (0.3 g/kg) may enhance glycogen synthesis when CHO is below optimal |
| **Strength/power athlete** | 0.5–1.0 g/kg post-workout; less critical than for endurance; total daily CHO intake more important |
| **Type** | High-GI (dextrose, maltodextrin, glucose polymers) most effective for rapid glycogen resynthesis; mixed meals acceptable for sessions >6 hours before next training |

### Post-Workout Meal Examples
- **Endurance athlete, 2-hour session:** 500 mL chocolate milk (~30 g CHO + 16 g protein) immediately → full meal 1–2 hours later (pasta + lean meat + vegetables)
- **Strength athlete:** Whey shake (25–35 g protein) within 2 hours → balanced meal 2 hours later
- **Whole food first approach:** 3 eggs + 2 slices toast + banana (~55 g CHO, ~22 g protein) — highly effective without supplements

### Sleep-Time Nutrition
- **Pre-sleep protein:** 40 g casein protein 30–45 min before bed → sustained overnight MPS (~25–30% higher overnight MPS than placebo); no impact on fat mass in energy-balanced individuals
- **Evidence:** Res et al., 2012 (*Medicine & Science* landmark trial); Snijders et al., 2015 (resistance training + casein before sleep = greater muscle hypertrophy over 12 weeks)
- Sources: cottage cheese (~30 g/250 mL), Greek yogurt, casein protein powder, milk

## Special Situations

### Fasted Training
- Common for recreational athletes training first thing in the morning
- **Fat oxidation** is higher fasted (increased lipolysis via elevated catecholamines, low insulin)
- **Performance** is reduced above lactate threshold (CHO-dependent efforts)
- **Muscle protein breakdown** is elevated; post-fast workout protein is urgent
- **Recommendation:** If performance is not the priority and session is moderate-intensity, fasted is acceptable; high-intensity sessions should include at least a small CHO snack pre-training

### Weight-Category Sports (Cutting)
- **Rapid weight loss (fluid):** Avoid; severe dehydration (≥2% BW loss) significantly impairs strength and endurance; heat illness risk
- **Gradual cut:** 0.5%–1% BW per week; maintain protein at ≥2.3 g/kg/LBM; prioritise training performance even in caloric deficit
- **Rehydration strategy:** After weigh-in → 1.5 mL per mL of sweat loss over 2–3 hours; 60–90 g/hour CHO to rapidly restore glycogen

### Vegan Athletes
- Higher risk of: B12 deficiency, creatine depletion, carnitine deficiency, carnosine (and β-alanine) under-supply, iron insufficiency, omega-3 (EPA/DHA) inadequacy
- Post-workout: pea + rice protein blend (1.5× dose vs. whey, ~0.6 g/kg, to match leucine delivery); fortified plant milks for Ca + D
- **Creatine supplementation particularly important** for vegans (25–50% higher ergogenic response vs. omnivores)
