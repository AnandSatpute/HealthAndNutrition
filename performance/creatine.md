# Creatine

## Overview
Creatine is a **naturally occurring nitrogenous compound** synthesised endogenously in the liver and kidneys from the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine (~1 g/day). It is also obtained from dietary meat and fish (~1–2 g/day from an omnivorous diet). As **creatine phosphate (phosphocreatine, PCr)**, it serves as the primary high-energy phosphate buffer in muscle cells, rapidly regenerating ATP during high-intensity, short-duration efforts. Creatine is the **most researched and evidence-backed performance supplement** in sports nutrition, with a 30+ year safety record and hundreds of RCTs.

- **Molecular formula:** C₄H₉N₃O₂ (MW = 131.13 g/mol)
- **Endogenous synthesis:** Arg + Gly → guanidinoacetate (kidney) + Met → creatine (liver); rate-limited by AGAT enzyme
- **Storage:** ~95% in skeletal muscle (60–70% as PCr); ~5% in brain, heart, testes; total body pool ≈ 120 g (70 kg male); replenished ~2 g/day
- **Half-life:** Creatine t½ in blood ≈ 3 hours; muscle creatine stores turnover ~1–2% per day (→ creatinine excreted via kidneys)

## Functions

| Function | Details |
|---|---|
| **ATP regeneration (PCr system)** | PCr + ADP → Cr + ATP (catalysed by creatine kinase, CK); provides immediate ATP during the first 5–15 seconds of maximal effort; dominates the ATP-PCr energy system |
| **Intracellular pH buffering** | Anaerobic PCr hydrolysis consumes H⁺ → buffers acidosis during high-intensity exercise → delays fatigue |
| **Satellite cell activation** | Creatine supplementation increases IGF-1 expression and Akt phosphorylation → promotes satellite cell differentiation → enhanced muscle hypertrophy signalling |
| **Myosin heavy chain isoform** | Shifts myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression toward type IIa fibres post-loading → power-oriented muscle remodelling |
| **Brain creatine** | Phosphocreatine serves a cognitive reserve function in the brain; supplementation raises brain [Cr] ~8% (MRS studies); neuroprotective in TBI, hypoxia, epilepsy animal models |
| **Osmoprotective** | Creatine is an osmolyte; cellular uptake increases intracellular water → increased cell volume → anabolic signalling (mTOR, MAP kinase) |

## Ergogenic Evidence

| Performance Type | Effect | Effect Size |
|---|---|---|
| **Maximal sprint power** | ~5–15% increase in peak power output (Wingate test) | Large |
| **Strength (1-RM squat, bench)** | ~5–15% increase in 1-RM over 4–8 weeks combined with resistance training | Large |
| **Resistance training volume** | ~15–25% more total reps per set before fatigue | Large |
| **Hypertrophy** | ~0.3–2 kg extra lean mass gain vs. placebo over 4–12 weeks (meta-analysis, Lanhers 2017) | Moderate |
| **High-intensity interval bouts** | Improved performance in repeated 10–30 second efforts; attenuates fatigue across bouts | Moderate |
| **Endurance** | Minimal direct effect; potential indirect benefit through enhanced training volume | Small/None |
| **Cognitive function** | Beneficial in sleep-deprived or cognitively fatigued states; task-specific (Rawson & Venezia, 2011) | Small-Moderate |

## Pharmacokinetics and Loading

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Rapidly absorbed from small intestine via SLC6A8 (sodium/chloride-dependent creatine transporter) |
| **Loading phase** | 20 g/day (4 × 5 g doses) × 5–7 days → saturates muscle stores (~20% increase) to ~160 mmol/kg dw; then maintain with 3–5 g/day |
| **Maintenance without loading** | 3–5 g/day → reaches same muscle saturation after ~28 days; preferred for GI tolerance |
| **Washout time** | ~4–6 weeks after cessation to return to baseline muscle Cr levels |
| **Creatine monohydrate** | Gold standard form; ~88% creatine by weight; most studied; cheapest; bioavailability ~99% |
| **Response variability** | ~25–30% of users are "non-responders" (already near-maximal muscle Cr saturation from diet; often higher baseline Cr levels, more type I muscle fibres) |

## Dietary Sources

| Source | Creatine Content |
|---|---|
| **Raw beef** | ~4–5 g/kg |
| **Raw pork** | ~3–4 g/kg |
| **Herring** | ~6–10 g/kg (highest natural source) |
| **Salmon** | ~4.5 g/kg |
| **Tuna** | ~4 g/kg |
| **Cod** | ~3 g/kg |
| **Vegetarians/vegans** | Essentially no dietary creatine → lower baseline muscle Cr → larger ergogenic response to supplementation |

> **Note:** Cooking denatures creatine → cooked meat contains creatine + creatinine; dietary intake from normal servings = ~1–2 g/day in meat-eaters.

## Clinical Relevance

### Muscular Dystrophy and Neuromuscular Disease
- Cochrane review: creatine supplementation increases strength and reduces fatigue in Duchenne MD, Becker MD, and other muscular dystrophies; modest but consistent benefit
- Mechanism: PCr supplementation bypasses impaired muscle energy metabolism

### Creatine Transporter Deficiency (CTD)
- X-linked disorder (SLC6A8 mutation) → no creatine in brain → severe intellectual disability, autism-like features, seizures
- Treatment: creatine arginine glycoside and cyclocreatine analogues under investigation; dietary creatine ineffective due to transport defect

### Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
- Pre-treatment with creatine reduces severity of TBI outcomes in children (RCT series from Ames, Italy); post-TBI use also under investigation

### Sarcopenia and Elderly Populations
- Creatine + resistance training most evidence-backed combination for improving strength and lean mass in adults >70 years; recommended by International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN)

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Carbohydrates** | Co-ingestion with CHO (~70–100 g) increases insulin → enhances muscle creatine uptake by ~60%; practically: take with fruit juice or high-GI meal |
| **Caffeine** | Early studies suggested antagonism of creatine's ergogenic effects; more recent data do not confirm this interaction; combined use appears safe |
| **NSAIDs** | Both creatine and NSAIDs cleared by kidney; theoretical but unconfirmed concern for renal load; creatine alone does not impair renal function in healthy individuals |
| **Metformin** | Metformin inhibits CK indirectly; theoretical interaction; not clinically established |
| **Creatinine (serum biomarker)** | Supplementation raises serum creatinine (breakdown product of creatine) → can falsely suggest reduced GFR; eGFR equations (MDRD, CKD-EPI) assume normal creatinine baseline — creatine users should inform physician |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Form:** Creatine monohydrate is preferred — most studied, cheapest, most effective; no credible evidence that creatine ethyl ester, buffered creatine, or creatine HCl is superior
- **Dose:** 3–5 g/day (maintenance); loading protocol only shortens time-to-saturation, not final effect
- **Timing:** Post-workout may have marginal advantage (Cribb & Hayes, 2006) but total daily dose is more important than timing
- **Hydration:** Increase water intake ~500 mL/day during loading phase (osmotic water retention in muscle)
- **Safety:** No adverse effects in healthy individuals at 3–5 g/day for up to 5 years (extensive safety data); only concern is in pre-existing renal disease (avoid or use with monitoring)
- **Vegans:** Higher response expected; even more beneficial to supplement given zero dietary intake
- **Regulatory status:** Not a controlled substance; legal in all sports; WADA-permitted; sold OTC worldwide
