# Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine / 5-HT)

## Overview

Serotonin is a monoamine indolamine neurotransmitter synthesised primarily in the **enterochromaffin cells of the gut** (~90–95%) and in the **raphe nuclei of the brainstem** (~5–10%). Despite most serotonin being peripheral, central serotonin drives mood, cognition, appetite, sleep onset, and pain modulation. Serotonin also serves as the obligate precursor to **melatonin**.

> **Key insight** — Serotonin cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Central serotonin is synthesised entirely within the brainstem from dietary tryptophan that enters the CNS. Gut serotonin regulates intestinal motility; it does not influence mood directly.

## Synthesis Pathway

```
L-Tryptophan  (dietary essential amino acid)
      │
      │ [Tryptophan hydroxylase — TPH1 (gut/pineal) / TPH2 (brain)]
      │  Cofactors: Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), Fe²⁺, O₂, NADPH
      │  ⚠ Rate-limiting step
      ▼
5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)
      │
      │ [Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase — AADC / DOPA decarboxylase]
      │  Cofactor: Pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP / Vitamin B6)
      ▼
Serotonin (5-HT)
      │
      ├──► Stored in vesicles (with chromogranins)
      │
      └──► In pinealocytes:
           │ [AANAT — arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase]
           │  Cofactor: Acetyl-CoA
           ▼
           N-Acetylserotonin (NAS)

### Step-by-Step Cofactor Requirements

| Step | Enzyme | Cofactors / Nutrients Required |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Tryptophan → 5-HTP** | Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH1/TPH2) | **BH4** (tetrahydrobiopterin), **Fe²⁺** (iron), **O₂**, **NADPH** |
| **2. 5-HTP → Serotonin** | AADC (aromatic amino acid decarboxylase) | **PLP** (Vitamin B6 active form), **Zn²⁺** |
| **BH4 regeneration** | DHFR, DHPR | **Folate (B9)**, **Vitamin C**, **NADPH** |
| **SAM availability** (for melatonin) | MAT → MTHFR → MTR | **Methionine**, **Folate (B9)**, **B12**, **Riboflavin (B2)**, **Mg²⁺** |

## Rate-Limiting Step in Detail: BH4 and Tryptophan Availability

**Two factors most commonly limit serotonin synthesis:**

### 1. BH4 (Tetrahydrobiopterin)
- BH4 is an essential electron carrier for TPH
- BH4 is depleted by oxidative stress; regenerated by dihydrobiopterin reductase (DHPR) using NADPH
- BH4 synthesis requires **folate (5-MTHF)**, **B12**, and **riboflavin (B2)** via the methyl cycle
- **Inflammatory cytokines** (IL-6, TNF-α) suppress BH4 synthesis, reducing serotonin

### 2. Tryptophan Competition — The IDO/Kynurenine Pathway
- Inflammation activates **indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)**, diverting tryptophan away from serotonin → toward **kynurenine pathway**
- This is a key mechanism linking **chronic inflammation → depression**
- Kynurenine accumulation can itself produce neuroinflammatory quinolinic acid (NMDA agonist)

```
L-Tryptophan
     ├──► TPH pathway → Serotonin  (brain/gut)
     └──► IDO pathway → Kynurenine → NAD⁺ or Quinolinic acid (neurotoxic)
              ↑
        Activated by: LPS, IFN-γ, IL-6, chronic stress
```

> **Niacin (B3) note:** Tryptophan is also the precursor to NAD⁺. In B3 deficiency (pellagra), tryptophan is diverted to niacin synthesis at the expense of serotonin.

## Degradation Pathway

```
Serotonin (5-HT)
      │
      │ [MAO-A — Monoamine Oxidase A]
      │  Located: mitochondrial outer membrane (neurons, gut, liver)
      │  Cofactor: FAD (Riboflavin / Vitamin B2)
      ▼
5-Hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde
      │
      │ [Aldehyde dehydrogenase — ALDH]
      │  Cofactor: NAD⁺ (Niacin / Vitamin B3)
      ▼
5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)
      │
      ▼
Excreted in urine
```

### Degradation — Key Points

| Enzyme | Location | Cofactor | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MAO-A** | Neurons, gut enterocytes, liver, placenta | FAD (B2) | Primary route of serotonin catabolism; inhibited by SSRIs, SNRIs, and MAOIs |
| **Aldehyde dehydrogenase** | Liver, brain | NAD⁺ (B3) | Minor route; also handles acetaldehyde from alcohol |

- **5-HIAA** in urine is the primary biomarker of serotonin turnover (elevated in carcinoid tumour; low in brain serotonin deficiency)
- **Alcohol** suppresses MAO-A → transiently raises serotonin → then rebounds lower
- **Oestrogen** upregulates TPH2 expression and downregulates MAO-A → explains premenstrual serotonin dynamics

## Cofactors and Nutritional Support — Summary

| Nutrient | Role in Serotonin Metabolism | Effect of Deficiency |
|---|---|---|
| **L-Tryptophan** | Dietary precursor | Low serotonin (Trp is essential — cannot be made) |
| **Vitamin B6 (PLP)** | AADC cofactor (5-HTP → serotonin) | Reduced conversion even with adequate Trp |
| **Iron (Fe²⁺)** | TPH cofactor | Impaired hydroxylation step; anaemia linked to serotonin dysfunction |
| **Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)** | TPH cofactor | Severe serotonin deficiency (e.g., PKU, DHPR deficiency) |
| **Folate (5-MTHF / B9)** | BH4 regeneration; SAM for melatonin | Reduces serotonin + melatonin; linked to depression |
| **Vitamin B12** | SAM regeneration (BH4 + melatonin pathway) | Downstream serotonin effects; depression risk |
| **Riboflavin (B2)** | FAD for MAO-A; BH4 synthesis | Dysregulated degradation; reduced enzyme activity |
| **Zinc** | AADC activity; modulates 5-HT3 receptor | Impaired decarboxylation |
| **Magnesium** | 5-HT2 receptor sensitivity; cofactor in SAM cycle | Anxiety, sleep issues (serotonin-related) |
| **Vitamin C** | BH4 stabilisation (antioxidant); reduces IDO activation via anti-inflammatory | Serotonin synthesis indirectly impaired |
| **Vitamin D** | Upregulates TPH2 in the brain; downregulates TPH1 in gut | Low central serotonin in deficiency |
| **Omega-3 DHA** | Maintains 5-HT2A receptor density; modulates IDO indirectly | Reduced serotonin signalling efficiency |

## Serotonin Reuptake (Recycling)

After release, serotonin is:

1. **Taken back up** via **SERT** (serotonin reuptake transporter) into the presynaptic terminal
2. **Repackaged** into vesicles (by VMAT2) for re-release, OR
3. **Degraded by MAO-A** in the mitochondria

> **SSRIs** (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) block the SERT transporter, increasing synaptic serotonin concentration. They do **not** increase serotonin synthesis — nutritional precursor support (tryptophan, B6, iron) is still necessary for efficacy.
