# Arachidonic Acid (AA) — Omega-6

## Overview
Arachidonic acid (AA) is a **long-chain omega-6 PUFA** with 20 carbons and 4 double bonds (20:4 n-6; Δ5,8,11,14). It is classified as **conditionally essential**: synthesised from linoleic acid (LA) via Δ6-desaturase → elongase → Δ5-desaturase, but synthesis may be insufficient in preterm infants or those with FADS gene variants. AA is the dominant **precursor to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids** (Series 2 PGs, TXA2, Series 4 leukotrienes) and also to **anti-inflammatory lipoxins**. It is a critical structural lipid in muscle and brain and is required for infant brain development.

- **Classification:** Long-chain omega-6 PUFA; conditionally essential
- **IUPAC shorthand:** 20:4 (Δ5,8,11,14) or 20:4 n-6
- **Primary dietary source:** Animal products (meat, eggs, fish)
- **Key characteristic:** Central hub of eicosanoid biology; substrate for COX, LOX, and CYP450 pathways; precursor to endocannabinoids

## Dietary Requirements

| Population | Notes |
|---|---|
| Healthy adults | No RDA; dietary intake ~150–500 mg/day in omnivores |
| Infants (0–12 months) | Required in formula at ≥0.5% of total fatty acids (FDA, EFSA); critical for brain and retinal development |
| Preterm infants | Particularly dependent on preformed dietary AA — endogenous synthesis from LA is inadequate |

> No established UL. Very high supplemental doses (>1.5 g/day) may theoretically increase pro-inflammatory eicosanoid production.

## Functions

- **Pro-inflammatory eicosanoid precursor (major function):**
  - **COX-1/COX-2 pathway:** AA → PGH2 → **PGE2** (pain, fever), **PGI2** (vasodilation), **TXA2** (vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation)
  - **5-LOX pathway:** AA → **LTB4** (neutrophil chemoattractant), **LTC4/LTD4/LTE4** (cysteinyl leukotrienes; bronchoconstriction in asthma)
  - **CYP epoxygenases:** AA → **EETs** (vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory; cardioprotective)
- **Lipoxin precursor (anti-inflammatory):** AA + 15-LOX (or aspirin-acetylated COX-2) → **LXA4/LXB4** — specialised pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that terminate inflammation and promote macrophage efferocytosis.
- **Structural lipid — brain:** AA is the most abundant omega-6 in the CNS; concentrated at sn-2 of PI and PE in synaptosomal membranes; critical for lipid raft structure and PIP2/DAG/IP3 second-messenger cascades.
- **Endocannabinoid precursor:** AA → **anandamide (AEA)** and **2-AG** — the primary endocannabinoids; relevant in pain modulation and appetite regulation.
- **Muscle anabolism (via PGF2α):** COX-2–derived PGF2α activates mTOR → muscle protein synthesis; AA supplementation increases this signalling.
- **Infant neurodevelopment:** AA and DHA are both required for brain and retinal growth; AA:DHA ratio in breast milk ~1.5:1; ARA added to preterm infant formula.

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Synthesis from LA** | LA (18:2) → GLA (18:3; FADS2) → DGLA (20:3; ELOVL5) → AA (20:4; FADS1) |
| **Dietary absorption** | Absorbed from meat/eggs as free FA or phospholipid; highly bioavailable |
| **Membrane incorporation** | Selectively incorporated at sn-2 of PI, PE, PC (Lands cycle); serves as membrane reservoir |
| **Release** | cPLA₂ (Ca²⁺-activated) releases free AA on inflammatory stimuli → eicosanoid synthesis |
| **COX pathway** | AA → PGH2 (COX-1/2; NSAID target) → synthases → PGE2, TXA2, PGI2 |
| **5-LOX pathway** | AA → 5-HPETE → LTA4 → LTB4 or LTC4 (glutathione conjugation) |
| **Lipoxin pathway** | AA + 15-LOX → LXA4/LXB4 (pro-resolving) |
| **Endocannabinoid pathway** | AA esterified in sn-2 of 2-AG or NAPE → AEA (anandamide) via NAPE-PLD |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | AA (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Salmon (cooked) | 85 g | ~350 mg |
| Tuna (cooked) | 85 g | ~300 mg |
| Chicken (cooked) | 85 g | ~120–160 mg |
| Pork (cooked) | 85 g | ~190 mg |
| Beef (lean, cooked) | 85 g | ~60–100 mg |
| Liver (beef, cooked) | 85 g | ~180 mg |
| Egg yolk | 1 large | ~60 mg |

> AA is found **exclusively in animal products**. Vegans rely entirely on LA→AA conversion; plasma AA is modestly lower in vegans but typically maintained by upregulated endogenous synthesis.

## Clinical Relevance

### Aspirin and NSAIDs
- Aspirin irreversibly acetylates **COX-1** (platelet) and **COX-2** → blocks AA→PGH2 → reduces TXA2 (antiplatelet), PGE2 (anti-pyretic/analgesic).
- COX-2 selective inhibitors (celecoxib) spare GI COX-1 but eliminate endothelial PGI2 (vasodilatory/antiplatelet) without blocking platelet TXA2 → net prothrombotic → increased MI risk (as seen with rofecoxib/Vioxx).

### Asthma and Allergic Disease
- Cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) cause bronchoconstriction and eosinophil recruitment — major mediators of allergic asthma.
- **Montelukast:** Leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTD4 receptor).
- **Zileuton:** 5-LOX inhibitor; blocks all leukotrienes upstream.

### Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD / Samter's Triad)
- COX inhibition by aspirin/NSAIDs shunts AA preferentially through the 5-LOX pathway → massive leukotriene surge → severe bronchoconstriction. Treatment: leukotriene antagonists + aspirin desensitisation.

### Infant Nutrition
- Preterm infants cannot synthesise adequate AA from LA; breast milk AA is essential.
- ARA (from fungal ARASCO) added to formula at 0.5–1% total FA; AA:DHA ratio ~1.5:1 mirrors breast milk.

### Dysmenorrhoea
- PGE2 (AA-derived) sensitises uterine/peripheral nociceptors → menstrual pain.
- NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) are first-line treatment — act by blocking AA→PGE2 synthesis.

### Sports Performance Supplement
- **AA supplementation (~1.5 g/day):** Small RCTs show increased muscular hypertrophy and strength (via PGF2α → mTOR → muscle protein synthesis); used as a bodybuilding supplement; evidence base limited.

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **EPA (omega-3)** | Competes with AA for COX and LOX; EPA:AA membrane ratio determines inflammatory eicosanoid balance |
| **DGLA** | Competes with AA for COX → produces anti-inflammatory PGE1; GLA supplementation boosts DGLA |
| **Aspirin / NSAIDs** | Downstream COX inhibitors — block AA→PGH2 |
| **Corticosteroids** | Upregulate lipocortin/annexin A1 → inhibit PLA2 → prevent AA release from membranes; most upstream pharmacological target in the AA pathway |
| **Zileuton** | 5-LOX inhibitor; blocks LTA4/LTB4/LTC4 from AA |
| **Vitamin E** | Indirect COX/PLA2 inhibitory effect; reduces AA-mediated lipid peroxidation |
| **Zinc** | Required for FADS1 (Δ5-desaturase) and FADS2 (Δ6-desaturase); zinc deficiency reduces AA synthesis from LA |

## Supplementation Notes
- **AA is not typically supplemented by the general population** — omnivore diets provide adequate amounts
- **ARA supplements (1–1.5 g/day):** Used by bodybuilders for muscle hypertrophy via COX-2/PGF2α/mTOR signalling; combine cautiously with high EPA intake (EPA competitively reduces AA-derived PGF2α)
- **Infant formula ARA:** Added as ARASCO (from Mortierella alpina fungus) to meet developmental requirements; DHA co-supplemented at ~1:1.5 DHA:ARA ratio
- **Anti-inflammatory strategies targeting AA pathway:**
  - Increase EPA/DHA → displaces AA from membranes
  - Reduce LA-rich seed oil intake → less AA precursor
  - GLA supplementation → DGLA↑, PGE1↑, competitive reduction of AA-derived eicosanoids
