# Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) — Omega-3

## Overview
Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is a **long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA)** with 20 carbons and 5 double bonds in the *cis* configuration (20:5 n-3). It is classified as **conditionally essential**: synthesised from ALA via Δ6-desaturation/elongation, but conversion from ALA is highly inefficient (<10%), making dietary preformed EPA from marine sources effectively essential for most people. EPA is the primary **anti-inflammatory eicosanoid precursor** (Series 3 prostaglandins, Series 5 leukotrienes, E-series resolvins) and competes directly with arachidonic acid (AA) for cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes. It is clinically established for hypertriglyceridaemia and is a major area in cardiovascular medicine.

- **Classification:** Long-chain omega-3 PUFA; conditionally essential
- **IUPAC shorthand:** 20:5 (Δ5,8,11,14,17) or 20:5 n-3
- **Primary source:** Marine fatty fish, krill, microalgae
- **Key characteristic:** The dominant anti-inflammatory omega-3; competes with AA for eicosanoid synthesis; precursor to E-series resolvins

## Dietary Requirements

| Population | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| General adults | No official RDA; most authorities recommend 250–500 mg/day EPA+DHA combined |
| Cardiovascular disease | ACC/AHA: ≥1 g/day EPA+DHA for patients with established CVD |
| Hypertriglyceridaemia | FDA-approved prescription EPA (icosapentaenoyl ethyl ester; Vascepa): **4 g/day EPA** |
| Pregnancy/Lactation | 200–300 mg/day DHA minimum; EPA typically included |

> No established UL for EPA from food. FDA considers up to 3 g/day from supplements Generally Recognised As Safe (GRAS). Doses >3 g/day may modestly increase bleeding time.

## Functions

- **Anti-inflammatory eicosanoid production (primary function):** EPA serves as substrate for COX-1/COX-2 and 5-LOX to produce **Series 3 prostaglandins** (PGE3, TXA3) and **Series 5 leukotrienes** (LTB5) — both dramatically less pro-inflammatory than the AA-derived Series 2 (PGE2, TXA2) and Series 4 (LTB4) counterparts. TXA3 is a weaker platelet aggregant than TXA2.
- **Resolvin E-series synthesis:** EPA is the precursor to **E-series resolvins** (RvE1, RvE2) and E-series protectins — specialised pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that actively terminate inflammation and promote return to tissue homeostasis.
- **Competitive inhibition of AA pathways:** EPA competes with AA for COX and LOX enzymes — increased EPA:AA ratio in cell membranes reduces the quantity of pro-inflammatory AA-derived eicosanoids produced upon cellular activation.
- **Triglyceride reduction:** EPA reduces hepatic VLDL-TG secretion by inhibiting diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) and stimulating β-oxidation via PPARα activation → reduces plasma triglycerides by 20–50% at pharmacological doses.
- **Platelet function:** EPA reduces platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 production → antithrombotic effect.
- **Endothelial function:** Increases nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability; reduces VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression; improves arterial compliance.
- **Gene regulation (PPARα/γ/δ):** EPA is a potent PPARα ligand → upregulates mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids; downregulates SREBP-1c (reduces lipogenesis).
- **Neurological:** EPA has mood-stabilising effects in depression; high EPA (vs DHA) fish oil preparations outperform placebo in MDD trials; mechanism may relate to anti-inflammatory action (reducing neuroinflammation) rather than direct neuronal membrane effects.

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Dietary absorption** | Absorbed as TAG, phospholipid, or free FA from small intestine → packaged in chylomicrons → lymph → plasma |
| **Integration into phospholipids** | EPA replaces AA/DHA in sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids (PL remodelling; Lands cycle); enrichment of cell membranes occurs over 4–8 weeks of supplementation |
| **Eicosanoid synthesis** | Membrane EPA released by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) → COX (→ Series 3 PGs/TXs) or 5-LOX (→ Series 5 LTs) |
| **Resolvin synthesis** | EPA + aspirin-acetylated COX-2 → 18-HEPE → RvE1/RvE2 (also via cytochrome P450 or 5-LOX) |
| **Retroconversion** | EPA can be retroconverted to ALA (minor pathway) |
| **Elongation to DHA** | EPA → 22:5 n-3 (DPA) → 24:5 n-3 → 24:6 n-3 (Δ6-desaturation) → DHA (peroxisomal β-oxidation; Sprecher pathway); rate-limited and inefficient |
| **β-Oxidation** | Excess EPA undergoes mitochondrial β-oxidation for energy |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | EPA (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Atlantic mackerel (cooked) | 85 g | ~1,000 mg |
| Wild salmon (cooked) | 85 g | ~600–1,000 mg |
| Herring (cooked) | 85 g | ~900 mg |
| Sardines (canned in oil) | 85 g | ~450 mg |
| Anchovies (canned) | 85 g | ~700 mg |
| Rainbow trout (cooked) | 85 g | ~400 mg |
| Oysters (cooked) | 85 g | ~400 mg |
| Tuna (canned light) | 85 g | ~170 mg |
| Krill oil (supplement) | 1 g | ~150 mg |

> Fatty cold-water fish are the most concentrated EPA source. Farmed salmon EPA content varies with feed composition (declining in recent years as fishmeal is replaced with plant oils). Wild-caught fish generally have higher EPA:DHA ratios. Plant foods contain negligible EPA.

## Clinical Relevance

### Hypertriglyceridaemia
- **Prescription-grade EPA (icosapentaenoyl ethyl ester; IPE; Vascepa®):** FDA-approved at 4 g/day for adults with serum TG ≥150 mg/dL; lowers TG by 20–30% in statin-treated patients.
- **REDUCE-IT trial (2018):** 4 g/day IPE added to statin therapy in patients with elevated TG and established CVD or high CV risk → 25% relative reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including CV death, non-fatal MI, stroke. Landmark trial; mechanism debated (anti-inflammatory vs. direct membrane stabilisation vs. plaque stabilisation vs. benefit from mineral oil comparator).

### Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
- Multiple meta-analyses show EPA-predominant formulations (EPA:DHA ratio >2:1, typically 1–2 g EPA/day) significantly reduce depressive symptoms in MDD.
- APA and ISSFAL guidelines support EPA+DHA as adjunctive treatment for MDD; EPA may be the more pharmacologically active component for mood.
- Mechanism: reduces neuroinflammation (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP); restores HPA axis regulation; may modulate serotonin signalling.

### Inflammation and Autoimmune Disease
- EPA reduces inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, TNF-α) in rheumatoid arthritis; fish oil supplementation (~3 g/day EPA+DHA) modestly reduces joint pain and morning stiffness — may allow NSAID dose reduction.
- Evidence in IBD, lupus, and psoriasis is mixed.

### Bleeding Risk
- At doses >3 g/day EPA+DHA: modestly prolongs bleeding time and reduces platelet aggregation. Clinically significant bleeding is rare but relevant in patients on anticoagulants (warfarin, DOACs) or antiplatelet agents.

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Arachidonic acid (AA, Omega-6)** | EPA:AA ratio in membranes determines eicosanoid balance; high dietary AA blunts anti-inflammatory effects of EPA |
| **Aspirin** | Aspirin-acetylated COX-2 preferentially converts EPA → 18-HEPE → RvE1 (resolvin); aspirin + EPA is synergistic for anti-inflammatory resolvin production |
| **Warfarin / DOACs** | EPA reduces platelet aggregation and TXA2; mild additive anticoagulant effect; monitor INR at high EPA doses |
| **Statins** | Synergistic for cardiovascular risk reduction (REDUCE-IT trial); statin+EPA recommended in high TG patients on statin therapy |
| **Vitamin D** | Synergistic anti-inflammatory; vitamin D receptors and EPA-derived resolvins share downstream inflammatory gene targets |
| **Vitamin E** | Protects EPA from peroxidation in the gut and in food storage; fish oil supplements should be stabilised with vitamin E (tocopherols) |
| **Alcohol** | Inhibits Δ6-desaturase (reduces ALA→EPA conversion); also promotes oxidative stress that degrades EPA |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Standard fish oil:** Most common source; look for products certified for purity (IFOS, NSF); typical dose 1–4 g/day for EPA+DHA combined
- **Ethyl ester (EE) vs. triglyceride (TG) form:** EE forms (most prescription and many OTC products) have lower bioavailability unless taken with a fatty meal; rTG (re-esterified triglyceride) forms have superior bioavailability. TG forms are more bioavailable but more expensive.
- **Krill oil:** EPA in phospholipid form — higher bioavailability per gram vs. fish oil TG; also provides choline and astaxanthin (antioxidant); smaller doses needed
- **Algal oil:** Vegan EPA source (some algal oils now provide EPA, not just DHA); recommended for vegans/vegetarians
- **Stability:** Store in opaque containers, refrigerated or frozen; fish oil goes rancid quickly — rancid oil may be harmful (avoid oil with fishy/metallic taste beyond fresh ocean smell)
- **Enteric-coated capsules:** Reduce fish burps; may slightly reduce bioavailability
