# Oleic Acid — Omega-9

## Overview
Oleic acid is the most abundant **monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)** in nature and in the human diet. It is an 18-carbon fatty acid with a single double bond in the *cis* configuration at the Δ9 position (18:1 n-9; Δ9). It is **non-essential**: the body synthesises oleic acid from stearic acid (18:0) via stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1; Δ9-desaturase), and it is abundantly available from olive oil, avocado, and nuts. Oleic acid is the primary fatty acid of the Mediterranean diet and is associated with cardiovascular protection, improved insulin sensitivity, and anti-inflammatory effects. Unlike the physiologically polar essential fatty acids (omega-3/6), oleic acid's roles are primarily **structural, metabolic, and energetic** with important regulatory effects.

- **Classification:** Non-essential monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA); Omega-9 (n-9)
- **IUPAC shorthand:** 18:1 (Δ9) or 18:1 n-9 or *cis*-9-octadecenoic acid
- **Most abundant MUFA in the human diet and body**
- **Key characteristic:** Predominant fatty acid of olive oil (~70–80%); cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet; endogenously synthesised

## Dietary Requirements

| Population | Notes |
|---|---|
| All adults | No AI or RDA established — not dietary-essential; endogenous synthesis is sufficient |
| General recommendation | Replacing saturated and trans fats with MUFAs (including oleic acid) is recommended by AHA and EFSA |

> No established UL. Oleic acid is considered one of the most benign dietary fatty acids. Very high intakes may contribute to excess caloric intake (all fatty acids: 9 kcal/g).

## Functions

- **Energy substrate:** Oleic acid undergoes β-oxidation in mitochondria — a highly efficient fuel (yileds 146 ATP per molecule). MUFAs are the preferred fuel source for the heart and oxidative muscle fibres under aerobic conditions.
- **Cell membrane structural component:** Oleic acid is the most abundant MUFA in cell membrane phospholipids. Incorporated at both sn-1 and sn-2 positions of PC, PE, PI — influences membrane fluidity: more fluid than saturated FA but less fluid than PUFAs. Oleic acid incorporation displaces saturated FA and helps prevent over-rigidification of membranes.
- **LDL remodelling — atherosclerosis protection:** Oleic acid-enriched LDL particles are more resistant to oxidation than LA-enriched LDL. Ox-LDL is the initiating event in atherosclerotic plaque formation; MUFA-enriched membranes have fewer oxidisable double bonds. Oleic acid replaces saturated FA (lowers LDL-C) and omega-6 PUFA (reduces LDL oxidisability) simultaneously.
- **PPARα/γ ligand (gene regulation):** Oleic acid activates PPARα (hepatic fat oxidation, VLDL reduction) and PPARγ (adipogenesis, insulin sensitisation) — contributing to its metabolic effects on lipid homeostasis and insulin signalling.
- **NF-κB inhibition (anti-inflammatory):** Oleic acid inhibits NF-κB activation in endothelial cells and macrophages → reduces expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1 (adhesion molecules), MCP-1, and IL-6 → reduces monocyte adhesion to endothelium (an early step in atherosclerosis).
- **HER2/neu downregulation:** In vitro, oleic acid downregulates the HER2/neu oncogene through a mechanism that potentiates trastuzumab (Herceptin) efficacy — suggests dietary oleic acid may have modest anti-tumour context in HER2+ breast cancer (human relevance unconfirmed).
- **SCD-1 product (lipid homeostasis):** SCD-1 maintains the ratio of saturated to monounsaturated FA in tissues. SCD-1 activity produces oleic acid from stearate and palmitoleic acid (16:1 n-7) from palmitate — critical for membrane fluidity homeostasis; excess dietary saturated FA without adequate SCD-1 activity → cell membrane rigidity, ER stress.
- **Cholesterol esterification (LCAT substrate):** Oleic acid is the primary fatty acid used by LCAT (lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase) to esterify free cholesterol on HDL → cholesteryl oleate — the main cholesterol ester form transported in plasma; relevant to reverse cholesterol transport.

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Endogenous synthesis** | Stearic acid (18:0) → Oleic acid (18:1 n-9) via **SCD-1** (stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1; Δ9-desaturase); requires NADH, cytochrome b5, O₂; located in ER membrane |
| **Dietary absorption** | Absorbed as free FA or within TAG micelles; incorporated into chylomicrons → lymph → plasma; very high bioavailability |
| **TAG storage** | Major component of adipose triacylglycerol; adipose MUFA:PUFA ratio reflects dietary MUFA intake |
| **Membrane incorporation** | Incorporated at sn-1 and sn-2 of phospholipids; Lands cycle remodelling continuously adjusts composition |
| **β-Oxidation** | 18:1 requires one additional step (enoyl-CoA isomerase for the *cis* double bond) vs. saturated FA; net yield: ~146 ATP; slightly less efficient per unit vs. stearate per β-oxidation cycle due to isomerase step |
| **Elongation** | Oleic acid can be elongated to eicosenoic acid (20:1 n-9; gondoic acid) — minor pathway |
| **Mead acid (stress pathway)** | In PUFA deficiency, Δ6/Δ5-desaturase converts oleic acid → **Mead acid** (20:3 n-9); elevated Mead acid (and elevated Mead acid:AA ratio, the "triene:tetraene ratio") is a biochemical marker of essential fatty acid deficiency |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Oleic Acid (g) |
|---|---|---|
| Olive oil (extra virgin) | 1 tbsp (14 ml) | ~10 g |
| Avocado oil | 1 tbsp | ~10 g |
| Hazelnut oil | 1 tbsp | ~10.6 g |
| Avocado (whole) | 1 medium (150 g) | ~10 g |
| Hazelnuts | 28 g | ~9 g |
| Almonds | 28 g | ~8.5 g |
| Macadamia nuts | 28 g | ~16.5 g |
| Peanuts / peanut butter | 28 g | ~7 g |
| Canola/rapeseed oil | 1 tbsp | ~8 g |
| Beef fat (tallow) | 1 tbsp | ~5 g |
| Eggs (whole) | 1 large | ~2 g |

> Olive oil is the richest and most studied source of oleic acid — extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) also provides polyphenols (oleocanthal, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol) that synergise with oleic acid's cardiovascular effects. Macadamia nuts are the richest whole-food source per gram.

## Clinical Relevance

### Mediterranean Diet and Cardiovascular Disease
- The **PREDIMED trial** (7,447 high-CV-risk adults; Spain): Mediterranean diet supplemented with EVOO (≥4 tbsp/day) reduced MACE (MI, stroke, CV death) by 30% relative to low-fat control diet — one of the landmark dietary RCTs.
- Oleic acid + olive oil polyphenols together appear to drive the cardiovascular benefit (oleic acid alone vs. EVOO shows attenuation of some benefits in mechanistic studies).
- Mechanism: LDL oxidation resistance, NF-κB inhibition, reduced platelet aggregation, improved endothelial function, blood pressure reduction, HDL raising.

### Lipid Profile Effects
- Replacing dietary saturated fat with oleic acid-rich MUFA:
  - **Lowers LDL-C** (similar magnitude to omega-6 PUFA substitution)
  - **Raises or maintains HDL-C** (better than PUFA substitution, which can lower HDL)
  - **Lowers TG** (vs. carbohydrate substitution)
  - Net result: improved total:HDL cholesterol ratio

### Insulin Sensitivity and Type 2 Diabetes
- Oleic acid-rich diets improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fasting glucose vs. saturated fat diets in multiple RCTs.
- Mediterranean diet (MUFA-rich) reduces T2DM incidence and improves glycaemic control in established T2DM.
- Mechanism: PPARγ activation, reduced ER stress, improved adipocyte function.

### Oleocanthal (EVOO Phenolic Companion to Oleic Acid)
- Oleocanthal (a phenolic in EVOO) is a non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor — mimics ibuprofen's anti-inflammatory mechanism; the throat irritation from EVOO is the "oleocanthal sensation" (shared with oral ibuprofen).
- Synergises with oleic acid's anti-inflammatory (NF-κB) effects → EVOO has broader anti-inflammatory action than refined oleic acid alone.

### Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency (Mead Acid as Biomarker)
- In PUFA deficiency (fat-free parenteral nutrition, malabsorption), Δ6-desaturase converts oleic acid → Mead acid (20:3 n-9).
- **Triene:tetraene ratio = Mead acid (20:3 n-9) : AA (20:4 n-6) >0.2** is the biochemical criterion for essential fatty acid deficiency — oleic acid metabolite elevates as PUFAs deplete.

### Blood Pressure
- High MUFA diets (olive oil-based Mediterranean diet) reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure in multiple RCTs; oleic acid may enhance endothelial NO production and reduce vascular smooth muscle cell signalling via NF-κB.

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Saturated fatty acids (SFA)** | Oleic acid replaced SFA in diet → lowers LDL-C; SFA and MUFA compete for membrane incorporation — higher MUFA:SFA diet improves membrane fluidity |
| **Omega-6 PUFA (LA)** | Both LA and oleic acid lower LDL-C; oleic acid raises HDL better than LA; LA-enriched LDL is more oxidisable than oleic acid–enriched LDL |
| **EVOO polyphenols (oleocanthal, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol)** | Synergistic anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects with oleic acid; cardiovascular benefit of EVOO exceeds that of refined oleic acid alone |
| **Vitamin E (tocopherols)** | Olive oil naturally contains vitamin E (α-tocopherol); antioxidant protection for MUFA against peroxidation; although MUFAs are much more resistant to oxidation than PUFAs |
| **SCD-1 activity** | High carbohydrate/fructose intake upregulates SCD-1 → increases endogenous oleic acid synthesis (de novo lipogenesis → palmitate 16:0 → palmitoleate 16:1, and stearate → oleate); relevant in metabolic syndrome/NAFLD pathogenesis |
| **Trans oleic acid (elaidic acid; 18:1 t9)** | The trans isomer of oleic acid (18:1 t9; found in partially hydrogenated oils/industrial trans fats) has opposite cardiovascular effects — raises LDL, lowers HDL, promotes inflammation; completely distinct from *cis* oleic acid |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Oleic acid is not typically supplemented in isolation** — olive oil, avocado oil, and nuts provide abundant dietary oleic acid
- **Extra-virgin olive oil (≥4 tbsp/day):** The most evidence-based "supplemental" MUFA intervention; used at this dose in PREDIMED; provides oleic acid + polyphenols + vitamin E
- **High-oleic sunflower/safflower oils:** Bred varieties with >80% oleic acid; very heat-stable (due to low PUFA, less prone to oxidative degradation); useful cooking oil alternative to seed oils; lacks the polyphenols of EVOO
- **Avocado oil:** High oleic acid + stable at high heat (smoke point ~270 °C) → excellent for cooking; lacks EVOO polyphenols
- **For cooking:** EVOO is appropriate for low-to-medium heat (sauté, roast); high-oleic sunflower or avocado oil for high-heat cooking
- **Storing olive oil:** Keep in dark glass, cool storage; oleic acid itself is oxidation-resistant but minor PUFAs and polyphenols in EVOO degrade with light, heat, and oxygen exposure
