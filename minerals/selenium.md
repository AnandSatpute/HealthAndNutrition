# Selenium (Se)

## Overview
Selenium is an essential trace mineral that is incorporated into proteins as the unusual amino acid **selenocysteine** — referred to as the "21st amino acid." Selenoproteins are the biologically active forms of selenium in humans; the human genome encodes 25 selenoproteins, many of which serve critical antioxidant and thyroid hormone regulatory functions. Selenium content in food is highly variable and reflects soil selenium levels.

- **Atomic number:** 34; biologically active as selenocysteine (Sec, U) in selenoproteins; inorganic forms: selenite (SeO₃²⁻), selenate (SeO₄²⁻)
- **Category:** Trace mineral
- **Body content:** ~13–21 mg in average adult; highest concentrations in thyroid, liver, kidneys, testes
- **Key fact:** Marginal selenium deficiency and toxicity (selenosis) occur in narrow intake ranges — the therapeutic window is relatively small.

| Infants 0–6 months | 15 µg/day (AI) |
| Infants 7–12 months | 20 µg/day (AI) |
| Children 1–3 years | 20 µg/day |

| Adolescents 14–18 years | 55 µg/day |
| Adults 19+ | 55 µg/day |
| Pregnant Women | 60 µg/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 70 µg/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 400 µg/day for adults.

## Functions
- **Antioxidant Defence (Glutathione Peroxidases, GPx):** Four major GPx isoforms (GPx1–4) reduce hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides using glutathione as electron donor — protect cellular membranes and DNA from oxidative damage. GPx4 specifically protects against ferroptosis.
- **Thyroid Hormone Activation:** Iodothyronine deiodinases (DIO1, DIO2, DIO3) are selenoproteins that convert T4 (thyroxine) to active T3 (triiodothyronine) or inactive rT3 — selenium deficiency directly impairs thyroid hormone metabolism.
- **Thioredoxin Reductases (TrxR1, TrxR2, TGR):** Reduce thioredoxin, maintaining cellular redox balance; essential for ribonucleotide synthesis (via ribonucleotide reductase), vitamin C recycling, and defence against reactive nitrogen species.
- **Selenoprotein P (SELENOP):** Major selenium transport protein in plasma (accounts for ~50–60% of plasma Se); delivers selenium to brain, testes, and other organs preferentially.
- **Sperm Motility (GPx5, SELENOT):** Selenoproteins are essential for sperm flagella structure and function — selenium deficiency can cause male infertility.
- **Cancer Prevention (mechanistic):** Selenium metabolites (methylselenol) may induce apoptosis in cancer cells and reduce angiogenesis; epidemiological association but supplementation trials have not consistently shown benefit in selenium-replete populations.
- **Immune Function:** Supports NK cell activity, T-cell proliferation, and antibody production.
- **Muscle Integrity (SEPN1):** ER-resident selenoprotein; mutations cause rigid spine muscular dystrophy.

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Glutathione (GSH)** | Electron donor for GPx reactions; requires cysteine, glutamate, glycine |
| **Vitamin E** | Synergistic antioxidant — works alongside GPx to prevent lipid peroxidation; deficiency of either amplifies effects of the other |
| **Iodine** | Selenium-dependent DIO2 converts T4 → T3; iodine and selenium deficiency together cause myxoedematous cretinism |
| **Sulphur amino acids** | Selenocysteine biosynthesis depends on serine and selenophosphate |

---

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | 50–90%; organic selenium (selenomethionine from plant proteins) absorbed at ~90%; inorganic selenite ~50% |
| **Best form** | Selenomethionine (organic) — highest bioavailability; incorporated non-specifically into body protein |
| **Distribution** | Selenoprotein P transports plasma selenium; concentrated in thyroid, testes, liver, kidney, brain |
| **Excreted as** | Trimethylselenonium, selenosugar in urine; garlic breath (dimethylselenide) at very high doses |
| **Half-life** | ~100 days (varies by tissue) |

## Effects of Deficiency
Dietary deficiency is common in areas with selenium-poor soil (parts of China, Europe, New Zealand, Africa).

**Clinical syndromes:**
- **Keshan Disease:** Selenium-deficient cardiomyopathy (dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, cardiac failure) — described in Keshan district, China; considered a selenium deficiency + coxsackievirus B cofactor. Preventable with supplementation.
- **Kashin-Beck Disease:** Osteoarthropathy (endemic to selenium-poor areas) — cartilage necrosis, joint deformity; multifactorial with selenium deficiency as a component.
- **Myxoedematous Cretinism:** Combined selenium + iodine deficiency in pregnancy → irreversible neurological damage in offspring.
- **Generalised:** Muscle pain/weakness, cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism symptoms, immune suppression, male infertility.
- **Critical care (ICU):** Low selenium associated with worse outcomes; selenium-depleted in prolonged ICU stays.

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Keshan disease / frank deficiency | 100–200 µg/day selenium (as selenomethionine) orally |
| General supplementation (low-intake population) | 55–200 µg/day (do not exceed UL of 400 µg/day) |
| Selenium-deficient ICU patient | IV sodium selenite 1,000 µg/day loading then 250–500 µg/day (evidence mixed; used in many European protocols) |
| Autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's) | 200 µg/day selenium – modest evidence for reducing TPO antibody titres |

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Chemotherapy (cisplatin) | Selenium may reduce nephrotoxicity and oxidative damage; some evidence selenium status affects cisplatin metabolism |
| Clozapine | Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis risk may be modified by selenium status |
| Statins | May reduce selenium-dependent CoQ10 pathway (minor interaction) |
| Valproic acid | Reported to reduce plasma selenium levels |

## Food Sources

Selenium content varies greatly based on soil selenium:

| Food | Serving | Selenium (µg) |
|---|---|---|
| Brazil nuts | 1 nut (5g) | 68–91 µg (can exceed UL with 6+ nuts) |
| Yellowfin tuna (cooked) | 85g | ~92 µg |
| Halibut (cooked) | 85g | ~47 µg |
| Sardines (canned in oil) | 85g | ~45 µg |
| Ham (roasted) | 85g | ~42 µg |
| Shrimp (cooked) | 85g | ~40 µg |
| Beef (lean, cooked) | 85g | ~33 µg |
| Whole wheat bread | 2 slices | ~16 µg |
| Egg | 1 large | ~15 µg |
| Enriched pasta (cooked) | 140g | ~33 µg |

> **Caution:** Brazil nuts vary enormously in selenium content — 1–2 per day is adequate; daily consumption of handfuls can easily exceed the UL.

## Storage & Stability
- Organic selenium (selenomethionine) in food is stable to moderate heat and storage.
- Inorganic selenite in food may be partially lost during prolonged cooking or high-heat processing.

## Toxicity (Selenosis)

| Intake Level | Effect |
|---|---|
| >400 µg/day (UL) | Hair and nail brittleness/loss (classic early sign), garlic breath odour (exhaled dimethylselenide) |
| >750 µg/day | GI disturbance, fatigue, neurological abnormalities (irritability, numbness) |
| >900 µg/day chronically | Selenosis — alopecia, nail changes, peripheral neuropathy, dermatitis |
| Acute poisoning | Vomiting, diarrhoea, respiratory distress, renal failure |

**SELECT trial note:** High-dose selenium supplementation (200 µg/day of selenomethionine) in selenium-replete men (US population) increased type 2 diabetes risk — supplementation beyond the RDA in replete populations is not recommended.
