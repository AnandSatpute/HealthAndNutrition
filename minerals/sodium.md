# Sodium (Na)

## Overview
Sodium is the principal extracellular cation and is the primary determinant of extracellular fluid (ECF) volume and osmolality. It is essential for maintaining fluid balance, blood pressure, nerve impulse generation, and nutrient absorption. Sodium is tightly regulated by the kidneys, aldosterone, ADH (vasopressin), and natriuretic peptides.

- **Atomic number:** 11; monovalent cation (Na⁺)
- **Category:** Macromineral / Electrolyte
- **Body content:** ~92 g in average adult; ~40% in bone (bound), ~55% in ECF, ~10% in intracellular fluid
- **Normal serum range:** 136–145 mmol/L (hypernatraemia >145; hyponatraemia <135)

## Requirements (AI / Chronic Disease Risk Limit)

> Note: No RDA is established for sodium as deficiency is extremely rare. Adequate Intake (AI) levels and chronic disease risk guidelines are provided.

| Age / Group | Adequate Intake (AI) | Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR) |
|---|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 110 mg/day | — |
| Infants 7–12 months | 370 mg/day | — |
| Children 1–3 years | 800 mg/day | ≤1,200 mg/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 1,000 mg/day | ≤1,500 mg/day |
| Children 9–13 years | 1,200 mg/day | ≤1,800 mg/day |
| Adolescents 14–18 years | 1,500 mg/day | ≤2,300 mg/day |
| Adults 19–50 | 1,500 mg/day | ≤2,300 mg/day |
| Adults 51–70 | 1,300 mg/day | ≤2,300 mg/day |
| Adults 71+ | 1,200 mg/day | ≤2,300 mg/day |

> **WHO recommendation:** <2,000 mg/day sodium (<5 g salt) to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.  
> **Average intake in Western diets:** 3,400–5,000 mg/day — roughly double the upper recommended limit.

## Functions
- **Extracellular Fluid Volume Regulation:** Sodium is the primary osmotic determinant of ECF; sodium retention → water retention → blood pressure.
- **Resting Membrane Potential:** Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase pump (3 Na⁺ out : 2 K⁺ in, per cycle) maintains cell electrochemical gradient crucial for excitability.
- **Action Potential Generation:** Voltage-gated Na⁺ channels open during depolarisation — the fundamental mechanism of nerve impulse conduction and muscle contraction.
- **Nutrient Transport:** Na⁺-coupled co-transporters absorb glucose (SGLT1/2), amino acids, phosphate, and water in gut epithelium.
- **Acid-Base Balance:** Na⁺-H⁺ exchangers help regulate pH in renal tubules.
- **Saliva and Gastric Secretion:** Na⁺ is a key component of secretory fluids.
- **Blood Pressure Regulation:** Sodium excess expands ECF volume → increased cardiac output and blood pressure.

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Potassium** | Maintains intracellular-to-extracellular Na⁺/K⁺ gradient; high potassium intake helps offset sodium-driven hypertension |
| **Aldosterone** | Steroid hormone (adrenal cortex) that increases renal Na⁺ reabsorption in the collecting duct |
| **ADH (Vasopressin)** | Regulates water reabsorption in proportion to sodium concentration |
| **Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)** | Released by atria in response to high ECF volume; promotes renal Na⁺ excretion |
| **Renin-Angiotensin system** | Renin → angiotensin I → angiotensin II → stimulates aldosterone; major BP-sodium control system |

---

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Nearly 100% absorbed — active (Na⁺-coupled) and passive throughout the GI tract |
| **Distribution** | ~55% ECF (plasma + interstitial); ~40% bone; ~10% ICF |
| **Regulation** | RAAS, aldosterone, ADH, ANP/BNP, renal pressure-natriuresis |
| **Excretion** | Primarily renal (~90% of intake); sweat and faeces for remainder; kidneys can excrete as little as 1–5 mmol/day under sodium restriction |
| **Sweat loss** | 10–70 mmol/L depending on acclimatisation; significant in heavy exercise |

## Effects of Deficiency (Hyponatraemia)
Serum Na⁺ <135 mmol/L. The most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalised patients.

**Causes:**
- **Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia:** Fluid loss with hypotonic replacement (diarrhoea, vomiting, diuretics)
- **Euvolaemic hyponatraemia:** SIADH, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, psychogenic polydipsia
- **Hypervolaemic hyponatraemia:** Heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome — dilutional

**Symptoms (severity correlates with rate of fall):**
- Mild: Nausea, headache, malaise, confusion
- Moderate: Disorientation, lethargy, muscle cramps
- Severe: Seizures, coma, brainstem herniation, respiratory arrest

> **Critical:** Rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia risks **osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS / central pontine myelinolysis)** — do not raise Na⁺ by more than 8–10 mmol/L per 24 hours in chronic cases.

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Acute severe symptomatic hyponatraemia | 3% hypertonic saline 100–150 ml IV over 20 minutes; repeat if needed; target 5 mmol/L rise in first hour |
| Chronic hyponatraemia | Fluid restriction ± oral sodium; treat underlying cause; max correction 8–10 mmol/L/24hr |
| SIADH | Fluid restriction (500–1,000 ml/day); vasopressin receptor antagonists (tolvaptan, conivaptan) |
| Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia | IV isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) to restore volume |
| Exercise-induced hyponatraemia | Hypertonic saline if symptomatic; avoid hypotonic fluids during prolonged exercise |

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Thiazide diuretics | Impair renal Na⁺ excretion at DCT but increase urinary dilution → hyponatraemia (most common drug cause) |
| Loop diuretics | Natriuresis → volume depletion hyponatraemia |
| SSRIs | Cause SIADH → hyponatraemia (especially in elderly) |
| Carbamazepine / oxcarbazepine | Cause SIADH |
| NSAIDs | Promote sodium and water retention → oedema and exacerbate hypertension |
| ACE inhibitors / ARBs | Block angiotensin II → reduce aldosterone → mild natriuresis; appropriate for hypertension |
| Amiloride / spironolactone | Block aldosterone / ENaC → promote Na⁺ excretion; potassium-sparing |

## Food Sources

> Most sodium intake comes from processed, packaged, or restaurant foods — not from the salt shaker.

| Food | Serving | Sodium (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Table salt | 1 tsp (5.7g) | ~2,325 mg |
| Canned chicken soup | 240 ml | ~870 mg |
| Soy sauce | 1 tbsp | ~900 mg |
| Deli ham | 85g | ~1,000 mg |
| Canned tomato sauce | 120 ml | ~650 mg |
| Hard cheese (parmesan) | 28g | ~449 mg |
| Pickles (dill) | 1 large | ~1,000 mg |
| Bread (white, commercial) | 1 slice | ~150 mg |
| Whole milk | 240 ml | ~105 mg |
| Fresh chicken breast (unprocessed) | 85g | ~55 mg |

## Storage & Stability
- Sodium is an element — it is not degraded by cooking or storage.
- Significant sodium is added during food processing and preservation; the food matrix (not intrinsic sodium) drives most intake.

## Toxicity (Hypernatraemia)
Serum Na⁺ >145 mmol/L. Most commonly from water deficit rather than sodium excess.

**Causes:** Insufficient fluid intake, diabetes insipidus, excessive sweating, osmotic diuresis, hypertonic fluid administration.

**Symptoms:** Thirst, restlessness, irritability → lethargy, weakness, twitching → seizures, coma, intracranial haemorrhage (from cerebral shrinkage).

**Treatment:** Gradual correction with hypotonic fluids (0.45% saline or D5W); do not correct faster than 0.5 mmol/L/hour to avoid cerebral oedema.

**Chronic high sodium:** Strong independent risk factor for hypertension, stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, kidney disease, and gastric cancer (via H. pylori-mediated inflammation at high salt concentrations). No UL is set as a true toxicity threshold, but the CDRR provides a clinical target.
