# Chloride (Cl)

## Overview
Chloride is the principal intracellular and extracellular anion. In the extracellular fluid, it is the main counter-ion to sodium, playing a critical role in maintaining osmotic balance, blood volume, and electrical neutrality. Chloride also participates directly in gastric acid production, carbon dioxide transport, and cell volume regulation.

- **Atomic number:** 17; monovalent anion (Cl⁻)
- **Category:** Macromineral / Electrolyte
- **Body content:** ~115 g in average adult
- **Normal serum range:** 98–106 mmol/L
- **Key fact:** Consumed almost entirely as sodium chloride (table salt) and other chloride salts in food.

## Requirements (AI)

| Age / Group | Adequate Intake (AI) |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 180 mg/day |
| Infants 7–12 months | 570 mg/day |
| Children 1–3 years | 1,500 mg/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 1,900 mg/day |
| Children 9–13 years | 2,300 mg/day |
| Adolescents 14–18 years | 2,300 mg/day |
| Adults 19–50 | 2,300 mg/day |
| Adults 51–70 | 2,000 mg/day |
| Adults 71+ | 1,800 mg/day |
| Pregnant Women | 2,300 mg/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 2,300 mg/day |

> No Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is established for chloride separately — the AI reflects combined intake as NaCl (sodium chloride), and sodium UL governs clinical guidance.

## Functions
- **Extracellular Osmolality:** Along with Na⁺, Cl⁻ is the primary determinant of extracellular fluid tonicity and volume.
- **Gastric Acid Production:** Cl⁻ is secreted by gastric parietal cells via H⁺/K⁺-ATPase combined with apical Cl⁻ channels to form hydrochloric acid (HCl, pH 1.5–3.5). Essential for protein digestion and pathogen killing.
- **Carbon Dioxide Transport (Chloride Shift):** In RBCs, CO₂ is hydrated to bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) by carbonic anhydrase; HCO₃⁻ exits the cell in exchange for Cl⁻ (the Hamburger/chloride shift) — moves CO₂ from tissues to lungs.
- **Nerve and Muscle Excitability:** GABA_A receptors are Cl⁻ channels; Cl⁻ influx hyperpolarises neurons (inhibitory post-synaptic potential). Glycine receptors also operate via Cl⁻.
- **Cell Volume Regulation:** Cl⁻ influx/efflux with Na⁺ or K⁺ regulates cell swelling and shrinkage.
- **Electrical Neutrality:** Balances cation charge across cell membranes and in plasma.
- **Bile and Pancreatic Secretion:** Component of digestive secretions; CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is a Cl⁻ channel essential for mucus and secretion hydration.

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Sodium** | Principal paired cation (NaCl) — chloride excretion/retention shadows sodium handling by kidneys |
| **Hydrogen (H⁺) / Carbonic anhydrase** | Drives chloride shift in RBCs and gastric acid formation |
| **CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator)** | Cl⁻ channel required for secretion hydration in lungs, pancreas, GI tract |
| **Potassium** | K⁺/Cl⁻ co-transporters (KCC) regulate cell volume and neuronal inhibition |

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Nearly completely absorbed in the small intestine; passive paracellular and active transport |
| **Distribution** | ~70% extracellular fluid; 20% intracellular; 10% bone |
| **Regulation** | Closely linked to sodium regulation via kidneys (RAAS, aldosterone); follows sodium reabsorption in most nephron segments |
| **Excretion** | Primarily renal; can be conserved below 1 mmol/day under severe restriction |
| **Sweat** | Significant losses in excessive sweating; cystic fibrosis patients have abnormally high sweat Cl⁻ (>60 mmol/L — diagnostic) |

---

## Effects of Deficiency (Hypochloraemia)
Serum Cl⁻ <98 mmol/L. Usually secondary to sodium depletion, vomiting, or excessive diuresis.

**Causes:** Prolonged vomiting (loss of HCl), prolonged nasogastric suction, loop/thiazide diuretics, metabolic alkalosis, SIADH.

**Symptoms:**
- Metabolic alkalosis (most characteristic consequence — loss of HCl leaves net bicarbonate excess)
- Muscle weakness, cramps, tetany
- Respiratory compensation (hypoventilation — retains CO₂ to buffer alkalosis)
- Confusion, lethargy in severe cases

**At-Risk Groups:** Patients with recurrent vomiting (eating disorders, hyperemesis gravidarum), prolonged NG tube drainage, high-dose diuretic users.

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Mild hypochloraemia | Oral NaCl (dietary salt restoration or saline tablets); treat underlying cause |
| Hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis | IV 0.9% NaCl (isotonic saline) to provide Cl⁻ and correct volume; KCl added if hypokalaemic |
| Severe alkalosis refractory to saline | Acetazolamide (promotes HCO₃⁻ excretion); rarely HCl infusion via central venous line |

---

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Loop diuretics | Promote urinary Cl⁻ loss → hypochloraemia and metabolic alkalosis |
| Thiazide diuretics | Renal Cl⁻ loss; less pronounced than loop diuretics |
| Proton pump inhibitors | Reduce gastric HCl secretion — clinically, not a major factor in serum Cl⁻ |
| Acetazolamide | Promotes HCO₃⁻ excretion → relatively increases serum Cl⁻ (hyperchloraemic acidosis) |

## Food Sources

> Chloride is consumed almost exclusively as sodium chloride (salt) and potassium chloride (salt substitute). Most natural foods contain minimal amounts.

| Food | Serving | Approximate Chloride (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Table salt (NaCl) | 1 tsp | ~3,550 mg |
| Canned soup | 240 ml | ~450–900 mg |
| Processed deli meats | 85g | ~500–1,000 mg |
| Soy sauce | 1 tbsp | ~950 mg |
| Sea vegetables (seaweed, kelp) | 28g | ~400–600 mg |
| Milk | 240 ml | ~170 mg |
| Bread (white) | 1 slice | ~100–200 mg |

## Storage & Stability
- Chloride (as a mineral anion) is not degraded by cooking, heat, light, or storage.
- Content in food is directly tied to added salt (NaCl) during processing or cooking.

## Toxicity (Hyperchloraemia)
Serum Cl⁻ >106 mmol/L. Usually associated with hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis.

**Causes:** Excessive normal saline (0.9% NaCl has supraphysiological Cl⁻ at 154 mmol/L); renal tubular acidosis; diarrhoea (HCO₃⁻ loss proportionally raises Cl⁻); acetazolamide; ammonium chloride.

**Clinical significance:** Hyperchloraemic acidosis is associated with renal vasoconstriction and reduced GFR. Balanced crystalloids (Ringer's lactate, Plasma-Lyte) reduce hyperchloraemia risk vs. normal saline in critical care.
