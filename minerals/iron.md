# Iron (Fe)

## Overview
Iron is the most abundant trace mineral in the human body, with approximately 2.5–4 g in average adults. It exists in two functional pools: **functional iron** (in haemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochromes, and iron-containing enzymes) and **storage iron** (ferritin and haemosiderin in liver, spleen, and bone marrow). Iron's primary biological role is **oxygen transport and electron transfer**, enabled by its reversible Fe²⁺ ↔ Fe³⁺ redox cycling.

- **Atomic number:** 26; exists as ferrous (Fe²⁺) and ferric (Fe³⁺) forms
- **Category:** Trace mineral
- **Key fact:** Iron deficiency is the most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide, affecting ~2 billion people.

## Functions
- **Oxygen Transport (Haemoglobin):** Fe²⁺ in haem of haemoglobin binds O₂ reversibly — each haemoglobin carries 4 Fe atoms and 4 O₂ molecules. ~70% of body iron is in RBCs.
- **Oxygen Storage (Myoglobin):** Iron in myoglobin stores and releases O₂ in muscle cells during exercise.
- **Electron Transport Chain:** Iron-sulfur proteins (Complexes I, II, III) and cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV) require iron for electron transfer — fundamental to ATP synthesis.
- **DNA Synthesis:** Ribonucleotide reductase (converts ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides) is an iron-dependent enzyme.
- **Catalase and Peroxidases:** Haem-iron enzymes that decompose hydrogen peroxide — antioxidant defence.
- **Neurotransmitter Synthesis:** Tyrosine hydroxylase (dopamine, norepinephrine) and tryptophan hydroxylase (serotonin) are iron-dependent.
- **Thyroid Hormone Synthesis:** Thyroid peroxidase (iodination of thyroglobulin) is a haem enzyme.
- **Immune Function:** Required for neutrophil bactericidal activity (myeloperoxidase) and T-cell proliferation.

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Vitamin C** | Reduces Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺ in gut lumen → enhances non-haem iron absorption (2–4× increase) |
| **Gastric acid / pepsin** | Releases iron from food matrix; reduces Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺ |
| **Copper (ceruloplasmin)** | Ceruloplasmin oxidises Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺ for transferrin binding; copper deficiency → functional iron deficiency |
| **Vitamin A** | Mobilises iron from ferritin stores; deficiency impairs iron utilisation |
| **Ferritin / transferrin** | Storage and transport proteins; iron loading requires these apoprotein backbones |

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Forms absorbed** | Haem iron (Fe²⁺, from meat/fish) — absorbed ~25%; non-haem iron (mainly Fe³⁺, plant foods) — absorbed 2–20% |
| **Absorption site** | Duodenum and proximal jejunum; DMT1 (divalent metal transporter) for non-haem; separate receptor-mediated for haem iron |
| **Enhancers** | Vitamin C, meat factor, acidic pH |
| **Inhibitors** | Phytate, polyphenols/tannins (tea, coffee), calcium, oxalate, egg yolk phosphoproteins |
| **Distribution** | ~70% haemoglobin; ~10% myoglobin + enzymes; ~20% stored as ferritin/haemosiderin |
| **Regulation** | Hepcidin (liver-derived hormone) is the master regulator — blocks ferroportin export from enterocytes and macrophages |
| **Excretion** | Minimal — 1–2 mg/day lost via gut cell sloughing, sweat, menstruation; no active excretion mechanism |

## Effects of Deficiency
Iron deficiency progresses through three stages:
1. **Iron depletion:** Ferritin falls, no anaemia
2. **Iron-deficient erythropoiesis:** Low transferrin saturation, elevated TIBC, microcytosis emerging
3. **Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA):** Microcytic, hypochromic anaemia — Hb <12 g/dL (women) or <13 g/dL (men)

**Symptoms:**
- Fatigue, pallor, exertional dyspnoea, palpitations
- Glossitis, angular cheilitis, koilonychia (spoon nails)
- Pica (craving non-food items — ice, clay, dirt)
- Restless leg syndrome
- Impaired cognitive development (especially children <2 years)
- Impaired thyroid hormone synthesis → secondary hypothyroidism

**Diagnosis:** Serum ferritin (best early marker), transferrin saturation, TIBC, reticulocyte haemoglobin content, peripheral smear.

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Mild-moderate IDA | Ferrous sulfate 200 mg (65 mg elemental Fe) oral 3×/day; alternate-day dosing may reduce GI side effects |
| Alternate oral agents | Ferrous gluconate, ferrous fumarate, ferric maltol (better GI tolerance) |
| Poor oral tolerance / severe IDA | IV iron — ferric carboxymaltose, iron sucrose, low-molecular-weight iron dextran |
| Functional iron deficiency (CKD, inflammation) | IV iron + erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) |
| Iron deficiency in pregnancy | 27 mg/day dietary + 30–120 mg/day supplemental as indicated |

> Take oral iron with vitamin C, on an empty stomach if tolerated. Separate from calcium, tea, and coffee by ≥2 hours.

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Antacids / PPIs | Reduce gastric acid → impair non-haem iron reduction and absorption |
| Tetracycline / fluoroquinolone antibiotics | Iron chelates drug → reduced antibiotic absorption; separate by ≥2 hours |
| Levothyroxine | Iron reduces absorption — separate by ≥4 hours |
| Bisphosphonates | Iron reduces absorption — separate by ≥2 hours |
| Calcium supplements | Compete at DMT1 transporter → reduce iron absorption |
| Deferoxamine / deferasirox | Iron chelators — used in iron overload |
| Methyldopa | Iron reduces absorption |
| Cholestyramine | Binds iron in gut; impairs absorption |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Iron (mg) | Type |
|---|---|---|---|

| Oysters (cooked) | 85g | ~8 mg | Haem |
| White beans (cooked) | 90g | ~3.9 mg | Non-haem |

## Storage & Stability
- Iron mineral content in food is not degraded by cooking.
- Cast-iron cookware can increase iron content of acidic foods significantly.
- Vitamin C in the same meal significantly improves non-haem iron absorption.

## Toxicity (Iron Overload)
- **Acute toxicity (children):** Adult iron supplement ingestion is a leading cause of poisoning in children; >20 mg/kg elemental iron can cause GI haemorrhage, metabolic acidosis, liver failure.
- **Hereditary haemochromatosis:** Autosomal recessive (HFE gene mainly) — unregulated iron absorption leads to systemic iron deposition (liver cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, bronze diabetes, arthropathy, hypogonadism). Treatment: phlebotomy.
- **Transfusional iron overload:** Frequent transfusions in haemoglobin disorders → chelation with deferoxamine or deferasirox.
- **Serum markers:** Elevated ferritin (>300 µg/L men, >200 µg/L women) + transferrin saturation >45% suggests overload; liver biopsy or MRI liver iron quantification for confirmation.
