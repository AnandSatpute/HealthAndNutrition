# Iodine (I)

## Overview
Iodine is an essential trace mineral required exclusively for the synthesis of thyroid hormones — **thyroxine (T4)** and **triiodothyronine (T3)**. Thyroid hormones regulate metabolism in virtually every cell in the body, making iodine indispensable for normal growth, development, and metabolic rate. Iodine deficiency is the world's leading preventable cause of brain damage and intellectual disability.

- **Atomic number:** 53; biologically active as iodide (I⁻)
- **Category:** Trace mineral
- **Body content:** ~15–20 mg; ~70–80% in the thyroid gland
- **Key fact:** Iodine deficiency affects approximately 2 billion people globally; iodisation of salt is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions.

## Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 110 µg/day (AI) |
| Infants 7–12 months | 130 µg/day (AI) |
| Children 1–8 years | 90 µg/day |
| Children 9–13 years | 120 µg/day |
| Adolescents 14–18 years | 150 µg/day |
| Adults 19+ | 150 µg/day |
| Pregnant Women | 220 µg/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 290 µg/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 1,100 µg/day for adults (includes all sources).

## Functions
- **Thyroid Hormone Synthesis:** Iodide is actively transported into thyroid follicular cells (via NIS — sodium-iodide symporter), oxidised to iodine by **thyroid peroxidase (TPO)** (selenium-dependent enzyme), incorporated into thyroglobulin at tyrosine residues to form monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT), coupled to form T4 and T3.
- **Metabolic Rate Regulation:** T3 binds nuclear thyroid hormone receptors → regulates transcription of genes controlling basal metabolic rate, thermogenesis, and oxidative phosphorylation capacity.
- **Growth and Development:** Essential for normal linear growth, bone maturation, and organ development.
- **Brain Development:** Critical in fetal and neonatal periods — T3 is required for neuronal migration, myelination, synaptic development, and dendritic growth. Deficiency → cretinism.
- **Cardiac Function:** T3 regulates heart rate and cardiac contractility.
- **Reproductive Function:** Required for ovulation and pregnancy maintenance.
- **Antimicrobial Properties:** Topical iodine (Lugol's, povidone-iodine) has direct bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity.

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Selenium (deiodinases)** | DIO1 and DIO2 convert T4 → active T3; selenium deficiency impairs T3 production |
| **Iron (thyroid peroxidase)** | TPO is a haem-containing enzyme; iron deficiency reduces its activity and impairs thyroid hormone synthesis |
| **Zinc** | Required for thyroid hormone receptor function and T3 binding |
| **Tyrosine** | Amino acid substrate for iodination (thyroglobulin tyrosine residues) |

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Essentially 100% of dietary iodide absorbed in stomach and small intestine |
| **NIS (sodium-iodide symporter)** | Concentrates iodide 20–40× in thyroid tissue against gradient; also in breast and salivary glands |
| **Thyroid uptake** | Radioiodine uptake (RAIU) is ~10–30% of administered dose normally; used diagnostically and therapeutically |
| **Thyroid hormone half-life** | T4: 5–7 days; T3: 1–2 days; rT3: 4 hours |
| **Excretion** | Primarily urinary (>90%); 24-hour urinary iodine is the best population-level marker of iodine status |

## Effects of Deficiency

**Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD) — a spectrum by life stage:**

| Stage | Manifestation |
|---|---|
| Fetal / neonatal | Cretinism (intellectual disability, deafness, spastic diplegia, short stature), stillbirth, miscarriage |
| Neonatal / infant | Neonatal hypothyroidism; impaired brain development |
| Child | Goitre, impaired mental and physical development, poor school performance |
| Adult | Goitre (compensatory thyroid enlargement), hypothyroidism, fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation |
| Pregnancy | Foetal brain damage; increased perinatal and neonatal mortality |

---

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Dietary iodine deficiency | Iodised salt; potassium iodide supplementation 150–300 µg/day; Lugol's iodine where necessary |
| Pregnancy iodine deficiency | 220 µg/day via iodine-containing prenatal supplement |
| Neonatal hypothyroidism | IV levothyroxine initiated immediately; iodine supplementation if cause is deficiency |
| Thyroid storm (emergency) | Potassium iodide (SSKI) given 1+ hour after thionamide to block thyroid hormone release (Wolff-Chaikoff effect) |
| Radiation emergency (nuclear fallout) | Potassium iodide tablets to saturate thyroid NIS and block radioiodine uptake: 130 mg KI for adults |

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Amiodarone | Contains 37% iodine by weight; causes drug-induced thyrotoxicosis (excess iodine → Jod-Basedow effect) or hypothyroidism (Wolff-Chaikoff) |
| Lithium | Inhibits thyroidal iodide uptake and thyroid hormone secretion → hypothyroidism |
| Goitrogens (thiouracil, propylthiouracil, methimazole) | Block TPO → reduce thyroid hormone synthesis; used therapeutically in hyperthyroidism |
| Perchlorate / thiocyanate | Compete with iodide at NIS → reduce thyroid uptake (cigarette smoke contains thiocyanate) |
| Radioiodine (¹³¹I) | Used therapeutically for hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer; requires stopping interfering medications |
| Soy isoflavones | High doses may interfere with iodine absorption and thyroid hormone synthesis |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Iodine (µg) |
|---|---|---|
| Seaweed (nori, dried) | 10g | 116–2,984 µg (highly variable) |
| Cod (baked) | 85g | ~99 µg |
| Iodised salt | 1/4 tsp | ~71 µg |
| Milk (cow, whole) | 240 ml | ~56 µg |
| Plain yogurt | 245g | ~75 µg |
| Shrimp | 85g | ~35 µg |
| Eggs | 1 large | ~24 µg |
| Canned tuna | 85g | ~17 µg |
| Prunes (dried) | 5 prunes | ~13 µg |

> **Note:** Non-iodised sea salt and gourmet salts do not contain meaningful iodine. Seaweed can provide dangerous iodine excess — excess iodine paradoxically inhibits thyroid (Wolff-Chaikoff effect).

## Storage & Stability
- Iodine in food is relatively stable. Cooking causes some losses (10–50% depending on method).
- Iodised salt loses iodine gradually when exposed to air, moisture, and light — store covered and dry.

## Toxicity

| Intake | Effect |
|---|---|
| >1,100 µg/day (UL exceeded) | May trigger hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow) in susceptible individuals |
| Wolff-Chaikoff effect | Acute iodine load transiently inhibits thyroid organification — normally escaped; failure in neonates / diseased glands |
| Jod-Basedow phenomenon | Iodine excess → hyperthyroidism in glands with autonomous nodules or Graves' disease |
| Seaweed-induced thyrotoxicosis | Reported from excessive seaweed consumption (particularly kelp supplements) |
