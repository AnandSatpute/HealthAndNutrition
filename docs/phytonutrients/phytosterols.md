# Phytosterols

## Overview
Phytosterols (plant sterols and stanols) are **structural analogues of cholesterol** found in plant cell membranes — they fulfil the same membrane-stabilising and fluidity-regulating role in plants that cholesterol does in animal cells. **Over 250 types** have been identified; the most abundant in the human diet are **β-sitosterol** (the most common), **campesterol**, and **stigmasterol**, which are sterols; **β-sitostanol** and **campestanol** are the corresponding saturated stanols. Daily intake in omnivorous Western diets is approximately **200–400 mg/day**; vegetarian and vegan diets provide ~400–700 mg/day. Phytosterols are the most evidence-based plant compound for LDL cholesterol reduction: at intakes of **2 g/day**, they reduce LDL cholesterol by **8–10%** on average through competitive inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption. This effect is robust, mechanistically well-understood, and forms the basis for their inclusion in functional foods (sterol-enriched margarines, yoghurt drinks, orange juice) and the guidelines of European, US, and Australian lipid bodies.

- **Type:** Triterpenoids (C₂₇–C₂₉); structural analogues of cholesterol with extra methyl or ethyl group at C24 of the side chain
- **Absorption:** Very poorly absorbed — physiological absorption of β-sitosterol is 0.4–4% (vs ~60% for cholesterol); stanols are even less absorbed (<0.1%); absorbed phytosterols are actively transported back into the intestinal lumen by ABCG5/ABCG8 half-transporters (the same efflux pumps that limit their accumulation)
- **Relationship to cholesterol:** Compete for incorporation into mixed bile acid micelles in the small intestine → displace cholesterol → less cholesterol absorbed; partially offsetting increase in endogenous cholesterol synthesis occurs but net LDL reduction is consistent

## Functions

| Function | Details |
|---|---|
| **LDL cholesterol reduction** | Inhibit cholesterol absorption by displacing cholesterol from intestinal mixed micelles → reduced cholesterol availability for chylomicron incorporation → lower LDL; 2 g/day lowers LDL by ~0.3–0.5 mmol/L (8–10%); additive to statins and dietary saturated fat reduction |
| **Anti-inflammatory activity** | β-Sitosterol inhibits NF-κB activation, reduces TNF-α and IL-6 production from macrophages; immunomodulatory effects studied in infectious disease models (β-sitosterol + sitosterolin) |
| **Immune modulation** | β-Sitosterol/sitosterolin combination: studied for enhancement of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses and NK cell activity; evidence from HIV and TB patient trials in South Africa |
| **Androgen pathway inhibition (BPH)** | β-Sitosterol inhibits 5α-reductase (reduces DHT) and anti-proliferative effect on prostate epithelial cells; meta-analysis of saw palmetto (rich in phytosterols) shows small but significant improvements in urinary symptoms in BPH |
| **Anticancer (preclinical)** | β-Sitosterol induces apoptosis in breast, colon, and prostate cancer cell lines via caspase-3 activation and Bcl-2 downregulation; inhibits tumour proliferation in animal models; human trial data are limited |
| **ABCG5/ABCG8 efflux** | Phytosterols are actively pumped back from enterocytes into the gut lumen by ABCG5/ABCG8 transporters → limits their own accumulation; loss-of-function mutations in these genes → sitosterolaemia (plant sterol accumulation disease) |

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Dietary digestion** | Phytosterols released from food matrix; esterified forms (in functional foods) hydrolysed by pancreatic cholesterol esterase in the small intestine → free sterols |
| **Micellar competition** | Free phytosterols compete with cholesterol for incorporation into mixed bile acid micelles; higher phytosterol → less micellar cholesterol → reduced mucosal uptake |
| **Intestinal uptake** | Minimal absorption via NPC1L1 (the same transporter as cholesterol); absorbed phytosterols immediately effluxed back by ABCG5/ABCG8 at the apical membrane or at the basolateral membrane back into the portal circulation and recycled to the gut |
| **Hepatic processing** | Trace amounts of absorbed phytosterols enter portal circulation → liver; ABCG5/ABCG8 in hepatocyte canalicular membranes secrete phytosterols directly into bile → excreted in faeces |
| **Sitosterolaemia** | Rare autosomal recessive disorder (ABCG5 or ABCG8 mutations): phytosterol absorption rises to 15–60% → plasma phytosterol accumulation → premature atherosclerosis, xanthomas, haemolytic anaemia; treatment: low-plant-sterol diet + ezetimibe |
| **No systemic conversion** | Unlike cholesterol, phytosterols are not converted to steroid hormones or bile acids in humans |

## Dietary Sources

| Food Category | Phytosterol Content | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Vegetable oils** | Corn oil: ~950 mg/100 g; rapeseed: ~600 mg; sesame: ~720 mg; palm: ~49 mg | Highest concentration sources |
| **Nuts** | Pistachios: ~280 mg/100 g; sesame seeds: ~700 mg; sunflower seeds: ~270 mg | Good everyday sources |
| **Legumes** | Lentils: ~70 mg/100 g; chickpeas: ~90 mg; kidney beans: ~75 mg | |
| **Whole grains** | Wheat germ: ~300 mg/100 g; whole wheat: ~65 mg; rye bread: ~37 mg | |
| **Vegetables and fruit** | Broadly ~10–30 mg/100 g; minor contributors at typical serving sizes | |
| **Functional foods** | Flora ProActiv, Benecol margarines, enriched yoghurt drinks: 2 g phytosterols per serving | Specifically fortified to provide therapeutic LDL-lowering doses |

> **To achieve the 2 g/day threshold needed for LDL benefit**, regular dietary sources alone are usually insufficient — fortified foods or supplements are typically required.

## Clinical Relevance

### LDL Cholesterol Reduction
- **Mechanism:** Confirmed via multiple RCTs; dose-response relationship: ~0.6 mmol/L LDL reduction per gram of phytosterol (effect diminishes above 2–3 g/day); effect size similar in normo- and hypercholesterolaemic individuals
- **Guideline endorsement:** European Society of Cardiology (2019 guidelines), National Lipid Association (USA), Heart Foundation (Australia) recommend phytosterol-enriched foods (2–3 g/day) as part of dietary management of hypercholesterolaemia, particularly for patients who cannot or will not take statins and as an adjunct to statin therapy
- **Potent additive effect:** Phytosterols + statin reduces LDL by an additional 8–10% beyond statin alone; mechanism is complementary (statins reduce synthesis, phytosterols reduce absorption)
- **Do not affect HDL or triglycerides** significantly at standard doses

### Cardiovascular Risk Reduction — Surrogate vs Hard Outcomes
- LDL reduction is a validated surrogate endpoint; **large RCTs with hard cardiovascular endpoints** (myocardial infarction, stroke) for phytosterols specifically are lacking; extrapolation from statin trials and LDL-lowering evidence supports efficacy
- Epidemiological data: higher plasma phytosterol levels associated with better cardiovascular outcomes in some studies, but also paradoxically with increased CVD risk in others (potentially reflecting impaired ABCG5/ABCG8 function in high-absorbers); this area remains controversial

### Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)
- Meta-analysis (Cochrane, 1998): β-Sitosterol modestly improves urinary flow rate and symptom scores (IPSS) in men with BPH; mechanism includes 5α-reductase inhibition (reducing DHT) and anti-inflammatory effects on prostate epithelium
- Saw palmetto extract (Serenoa repens) — rich in phytosterols including β-sitosterol — has inconsistent evidence in larger, more rigorous RCTs (Wilt et al., Cochrane Review); European Medicines Agency (EMA) recognises it as a "traditional herbal medicinal product" for mild-to-moderate BPH

### Fat-Soluble Vitamin Caution
- High phytosterol intake (>3 g/day) may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and carotenoids (β-carotene, lycopene): some studies show 10–20% reductions in plasma β-carotene and α-tocopherol
- Functional foods with phytosterols are sometimes enriched with vitamins A and D to compensate
- Clinical significance of this interaction at recommended doses (2–3 g/day) is debated but monitoring/compensation is prudent

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Statins** | Additive LDL reduction (~additional 8–10%); complementary mechanisms (HMGCR inhibition + reduced absorption); widely recommended combination |
| **Ezetimibe** | Both phytosterols and ezetimibe (NPC1L1 inhibitor) reduce cholesterol absorption; effects partially additive; ezetimibe also reduces phytosterol absorption (useful in sitosterolaemia) |
| **Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)** | Phytosterols reduce micellar solubilisation of fat-soluble vitamins → modest reduction in absorption; consume phytosterol-enriched foods with meals containing carotenoid-rich vegetables |
| **Dietary fat** | Phytosterols must be consumed with food (specifically with fat) for efficacy — they act in the intestinal lumen during fat digestion; fat-free phytosterol supplements taken away from meals are significantly less effective |
| **Bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, colesevelam)** | Additive cholesterol lowering; independent mechanism; may be combined; both reduce cholesterol absorption/recirculation |
| **Orlistat** | Reduces fat absorption → may reduce phytosterol absorption as well; avoid high-dose phytosterol supplements with orlistat due to reduced efficacy |
| **Anticoagulants (Warfarin)** | Phytosterols may modestly reduce vitamin K absorption → theoretical effect on warfarin sensitivity; evidence is weak but INR monitoring appropriate during initiation |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Functional food approach (preferred):** Spreads (e.g., Flora ProActiv, Benecol), yoghurt drinks, orange juice fortified to provide 2 g phytosterols/day; most RCTs used this delivery form; phytosterols must be consumed WITH fat-containing meals to work
- **Phytosterol supplements (capsules/tablets):** Available; efficacy less robustly studied than functional food forms; standardised products providing 2 g/day phytosterols are clinically reasonable; ensure fat co-ingestion
- **Recommended dose:** 2 g/day of free plant sterols or stanols consistently supported; no additional LDL benefit above 3 g/day; doses above 3 g/day increase risk of carotenoid/fat-soluble vitamin reduction
- **Who benefits most:** Patients with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolaemia; as an adjunct to statins; patients intolerant of or unwilling to start statins; familial hypercholesterolaemia as adjunct therapy
- **Who should avoid:** Children under 5 (no safety data); pregnant or breastfeeding women (avoid routine supplementation); patients with sitosterolaemia (absolute contraindication — use ezetimibe instead)
- **Stanols vs sterols:** Stanols (saturated form, e.g., Benecol's sitostanol) are absorbed even less than sterols and do not accumulate; both show equivalent LDL reduction at equivalent doses; stanols may be preferred in patients with high phytosterol absorption (sitosterolaemia trait carriers)
