# Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA) — Omega-3

## Overview
Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is an **essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)** — the body cannot synthesise it de novo, so it must be obtained from the diet. It is an 18-carbon fatty acid with three double bonds in the *cis* configuration (18:3 n-3; Δ9,12,15). ALA is the **plant-kingdom precursor** of the longer-chain omega-3s EPA (20:5 n-3) and DHA (22:6 n-3), though conversion efficiency is low in humans. It serves primarily as an energy substrate and an elongation/desaturation precursor, and has independent roles in reducing cardiovascular risk.

- **Classification:** Essential fatty acid; Omega-3 (n-3) PUFA
- **IUPAC shorthand:** 18:3 (Δ9,12,15) or 18:3 n-3
- **Melting point:** −11 °C (liquid at room temperature and body temperature)
- **Key characteristic:** Most abundant omega-3 in the plant kingdom; prone to oxidation (3 double bonds)

## Dietary Requirements

| Population | AI (Adequate Intake) |
|---|---|
| Adult men (≥19 yrs) | **1.6 g/day** |
| Adult women (≥19 yrs) | **1.1 g/day** |
| Pregnancy | 1.4 g/day |
| Lactation | 1.3 g/day |

> No established UL for ALA. Very high intakes from food sources not associated with toxicity. Supplemental flaxseed oil at high doses may cause GI upset and loose stools.

## Functions

- **Precursor to EPA and DHA:** ALA undergoes elongation and desaturation (Δ6-desaturase → Δ5-desaturase pathway) to yield EPA and then DHA. This is the only endogenous route to omega-3 EPA/DHA in humans. However, conversion is inefficient: only ~5–10% of ALA converts to EPA and <1% to DHA in healthy adults.
- **Energy substrate:** The majority (~70–85%) of ingested ALA is β-oxidised for energy in mitochondria and peroxisomes; it is a normal fuel.
- **Cell membrane phospholipids:** Incorporated into phospholipids (mainly phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine) in cell membranes, influencing membrane fluidity and receptor function — though to a lesser extent than EPA/DHA.
- **Anti-inflammatory precursor:** EPA derived from ALA competes with arachidonic acid (AA) for cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX), reducing pro-inflammatory eicosanoid (prostaglandin E2, leukotriene B4) production.
- **Cardiovascular protection:** Epidemiological studies associate higher ALA intake with reduced risk of fatal coronary heart disease; proposed mechanisms include reduced platelet aggregation, antiarrhythmic effects, and modest LDL-lowering.
- **Gene regulation (PPARα/γ):** ALA and its metabolites are ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR-α, PPAR-γ), influencing fatty acid oxidation, adipogenesis, and inflammation.

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Absorbed from the small intestine as free fatty acid or within TAG micelles; packaged into chylomicrons → lymph → circulation |
| **β-Oxidation** | ~70–85% undergoes mitochondrial/peroxisomal β-oxidation for energy |
| **Elongation** | ALA (18:3 n-3) + elongase → 20:3 n-3 (ETE) |
| **Δ6-Desaturation (rate-limiting)** | ALA → 18:4 n-3 (stearidonic acid; SDA) via Δ6-desaturase (FADS2); rate-limiting step; competes with LA (Δ6-desaturation of omega-6) |
| **Δ5-Desaturation** | 20:4 n-3 → EPA (20:5 n-3) via Δ5-desaturase (FADS1) |
| **Further elongation → DHA** | EPA → 24:5 n-3 → 24:6 n-3 (Δ6-desaturation in peroxisomes) → DHA (22:6 n-3) via retroconversion (Sprecher pathway) |
| **Key limiting factors** | High omega-6 (LA) competitively inhibits Δ6-desaturase; alcohol, trans fats, zinc deficiency, ageing reduce FADS2 activity |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | ALA (g) |
|---|---|---|
| Flaxseed (ground) | 1 tbsp (7 g) | ~1.6 g |
| Flaxseed oil | 1 tbsp (14 ml) | ~7.3 g |
| Chia seeds | 28 g | ~5.1 g |
| Walnuts (English) | 28 g | ~2.6 g |
| Hemp seeds | 28 g | ~1.0 g |
| Canola (rapeseed) oil | 1 tbsp | ~1.3 g |
| Soybean oil | 1 tbsp | ~0.9 g |
| Edamame (cooked) | 100 g | ~0.3 g |

> Flaxseed oil and chia seeds are the most concentrated plant sources. Ground flaxseed is preferred over whole (improved bioavailability). ALA in plant foods degrades with heat and prolonged storage (oxidation).

## Clinical Relevance

### Cardiovascular Disease
- The PREDIMED and CARDIOFIT cohort data associate higher ALA intake with lower risk of fatal MI and cardiac arrhythmia.
- ALA does not raise LDL; may modestly lower triglycerides and blood pressure at doses >3 g/day.
- The benefit appears partly independent of EPA/DHA conversion — likely via antiarrhythmic membrane effects and reduced platelet aggregation.

### ALA vs. Preformed EPA/DHA
- Strictly vegan/vegetarian individuals relying solely on ALA for omega-3 status often have suboptimal DHA levels (brain/retina DHA is almost entirely dependent on dietary preformed DHA or very efficient conversion).
- Algal oil (direct DHA source from microalgae — the original producers of marine omega-3s) is the recommended DHA supplement for vegans.
- Stearidonic acid (SDA)-enriched soybean oil converts to EPA more efficiently than ALA (~3× the conversion rate) and may be a more effective plant-based omega-3 source.

### Δ6-Desaturase Polymorphisms (FADS2)
- Common variants in *FADS1/FADS2* genes significantly affect ALA→EPA→DHA conversion efficiency; some individuals are poor converters requiring preformed EPA/DHA.

### Prostate Cancer Controversy
- Older epidemiological studies suggested high ALA may increase prostate cancer risk; subsequent meta-analyses have not confirmed this relationship. Current evidence does not support restricting ALA for this reason.

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Linoleic acid (LA, Omega-6)** | Competes with ALA for Δ6-desaturase; high LA:ALA ratio (typical Western diet ~15–20:1) substantially suppresses ALA conversion to EPA/DHA; optimal ratio ~4:1 |
| **Zinc** | Cofactor for Δ6-desaturase; zinc deficiency impairs ALA→EPA conversion |
| **Vitamin B6** | Required for elongase and desaturase steps in fatty acid metabolism |
| **Magnesium** | Cofactor for FADS enzymes |
| **Trans fatty acids** | Inhibit Δ6-desaturase; high trans fat intake reduces ALA→EPA/DHA conversion |
| **Alcohol** | Inhibits Δ6-desaturase; chronic alcohol use reduces EPA/DHA synthesis from ALA |
| **Vitamin E** | Protects ALA from peroxidation; foods high in ALA (flax, chia) and ALA supplements should be accompanied by adequate vitamin E |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Flaxseed oil (1–2 tbsp/day):** Most common ALA supplement; prone to rancidity — store refrigerated in dark bottles; consume within 6 weeks of opening
- **Ground flaxseed (2 tbsp/day):** More stable than oil; also provides lignans (phytoestrogenic antioxidants) and fibre; superior for most uses
- **Chia seeds:** Stable shelf life; good ALA source plus fibre and calcium
- **ALA does not reliably raise DHA levels** — vegans should also supplement with algal DHA (200–400 mg/day) for neurological and retinal health
- Cooking with ALA-rich oils at high heat should be avoided — use for cold dressings; use more heat-stable oils (avocado, coconut) for frying
