# Linoleic Acid (LA) — Omega-6

## Overview
Linoleic acid (LA) is an **essential omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)** — the parent omega-6 fatty acid that the body cannot synthesise, making dietary intake mandatory. It is an 18-carbon fatty acid with two double bonds (18:2 n-6; Δ9,12). LA is the **most abundant PUFA in the human diet** and the metabolic precursor to all omega-6 PUFA derivatives, most importantly arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4 n-6). Through AA, LA is the ultimate precursor to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (Series 2 prostaglandins, Series 4 leukotrienes, thromboxane A2). LA is absolutely required for: skin barrier integrity (structural ceramide acylation), immune function, and cell membrane composition.

- **Classification:** Essential fatty acid; Omega-6 (n-6) PUFA
- **IUPAC shorthand:** 18:2 (Δ9,12) or 18:2 n-6
- **Most abundant PUFA in the Western diet**
- **Key characteristic:** Parent omega-6; sole precursor to arachidonic acid; critical for skin barrier integrity

## Dietary Requirements

| Population | AI (Adequate Intake) |
|---|---|
| Adult men (≥19 yrs) | **17 g/day** |
| Adult women (≥19 yrs) | **12 g/day** |
| Pregnancy | 13 g/day |
| Lactation | 13 g/day |

> The Western diet provides ~15–25 g/day LA — well above AI. No established UL. Very high intakes (>10% of energy from LA) may theoretically increase oxidative stress and promote pro-inflammatory AA production, though this is debated.

## Functions

- **Skin barrier integrity (uniquely essential):** LA is incorporated via ester linkage into **ceramide-1-acylceramide** (acylceramide) — the specific ceramide species in the stratum corneum responsible for the water-impermeable lamellar membrane of the skin. No other fatty acid can substitute in this role. LA deficiency → scaly skin, increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and impaired skin barrier — the classic cutaneous LA deficiency syndrome.
- **Cell membrane structural lipid:** LA and AA (its derivative) are major components of the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids; determine membrane fluidity and microdomain (lipid raft) properties.
- **Precursor to arachidonic acid (AA):** LA → γ-Linolenic acid (GLA; 18:3 n-6; via Δ6-desaturase) → AA (20:4 n-6); AA is the substrate for Series 2 prostaglandins (PGE2, PGI2, TXA2), Series 4 leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4), and 12-HETE — predominantly pro-inflammatory mediators critical for immune activation, platelet aggregation, and vascular tone.
- **Precursor to DGLA:** LA → GLA → DGLA (dihomo-γ-linolenic acid; 20:3 n-6) → Series 1 prostaglandins (PGE1) — **anti-inflammatory**; DGLA competes with AA for COX; GLA/DGLA supplementation (evening primrose oil, borage oil) exploits this to reduce inflammation.
- **Eicosanoid source via AA:** AA-derived PGE2, TXA2, and LTB4 are essential mediators of the inflammatory response, pain sensitisation, platelet aggregation, and bronchoconstriction — functions that require tightly regulated omega-6 AA-eicosanoid signalling.
- **Lipoxin precursor:** AA is also the precursor to lipoxins (LXA4, LXB4) — specialised pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that signal anti-inflammatory resolution; LA→AA pathway thus participates in both initiation and resolution of inflammation.
- **Gene regulation (PPARγ):** LA and its metabolites activate PPARγ → adipogenesis, insulin sensitisation; LA-rich diets associated with modest insulin sensitivity improvements vs. saturated fat–rich diets.

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Dietary absorption** | Absorbed in small intestine as free FA or within TAG/PL; packaged in chylomicrons |
| **Δ6-Desaturation (rate-limiting)** | LA (18:2 n-6) → GLA (18:3 n-6) via Δ6-desaturase (FADS2); competes with ALA for the same enzyme; the dominant pathway (LA >> ALA in typical Western diet) |
| **Elongation** | GLA (18:3 n-6) → DGLA (20:3 n-6) via elongase (ELOVL5) |
| **Δ5-Desaturation** | DGLA (20:3 n-6) → AA (20:4 n-6) via Δ5-desaturase (FADS1) |
| **Membrane incorporation** | AA preferentially esterified at sn-2 position of PC, PE, PI in cell membranes; serves as AA reservoir |
| **Eicosanoid liberation** | Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) releases AA from membranes on inflammatory stimulus → COX/LOX → eicosanoids |
| **Skin ceramide pathway** | LA esterified to ω-hydroxy fatty acid → acylceramide (EOS ceramide class) → lamellar body secretion → stratum corneum |
| **β-Oxidation** | Excess LA oxidised for energy via mitochondrial β-oxidation |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | LA (g) |
|---|---|---|
| Sunflower oil (high-LA) | 1 tbsp | ~9 g |
| Safflower oil | 1 tbsp | ~10 g |
| Corn oil | 1 tbsp | ~7 g |
| Soybean oil | 1 tbsp | ~7 g |
| Walnuts | 28 g | ~10.8 g |
| Sunflower seeds | 28 g | ~6.5 g |
| Pine nuts | 28 g | ~9.4 g |
| Peanut butter | 2 tbsp | ~4.4 g |
| Chicken (dark meat, cooked) | 85 g | ~1.8 g |
| Tofu | 100 g | ~2.2 g |

> LA is ubiquitous in modern diets — vegetable/seed oils (sunflower, corn, soybean) are dominant sources and have dramatically increased LA intake over the 20th century (estimated 2–3× increase in total Western LA consumption). This shift has increased the omega-6:omega-3 ratio from ~4:1 (traditional diets) to ~15–20:1.

## Clinical Relevance

### LA Deficiency
- Classic presentation: **scaly, ichthyotic skin, increased TEWL, alopecia, poor wound healing, impaired growth** — caused by failure to form the essential acylceramide skin barrier ceramide.
- Occurs primarily in: patients on long-term fat-free parenteral nutrition, very-low-fat enteral formulas, rare fat malabsorption disorders (cystic fibrosis, short bowel syndrome), and historically in infants fed LA-deficient formula.
- Treatment: topical or dietary LA (even cutaneous application of sunflower oil can correct skin barrier defects in deficient patients).

### Omega-6:Omega-3 Ratio
- The extremely high LA intake in modern Western diets (~15–25 g/day) vs. modest omega-3 intake suppresses ALA→EPA/DHA conversion (competitive Δ6-desaturase inhibition) and floods the eicosanoid system with pro-inflammatory AA-derived mediators.
- **Current consensus:** Rather than avoid LA, the most effective strategy is **increasing omega-3 intake** to improve the balance; lowering LA intake is secondary and harder to achieve.
- There is active debate on whether high LA intake per se is pro-inflammatory or whether it is simply neutral in the context of adequate omega-3 ingestion.

### Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA)
- **CLA** is a group of LA isomers produced by bacterial biohydrogenation in ruminant animals; found in beef fat and dairy.
- CLA (specifically *c9,t11-CLA* and *t10,c12-CLA*) studied for effects on body composition (modest anti-obesity effect), anticancer properties, and insulin resistance. Evidence is mixed and doses required (3–6 g/day) exceed dietary amounts.

### GLA Supplementation (Evening Primrose / Borage Oil)
- GLA (LA metabolite) → DGLA → PGE1 (anti-inflammatory) with less conversion to AA
- Used for: atopic dermatitis/eczema (mixed evidence), PMS and mastalgia (modest benefit), rheumatoid arthritis (modest joint pain reduction at 2–3 g/day GLA).

### Cardiovascular Disease
- Replacing saturated fat with LA (polyunsaturated fat) reduces LDL-C and total:HDL ratio → associated with reduced CVD risk in meta-analyses.
- AHA recommends replacing saturated fat with PUFA (primarily LA-rich oils) — projected to reduce CVD risk by ~20% for each 5% energy substitution.

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **ALA (Omega-3)** | Competitive substrate for Δ6-desaturase; high LA blunts ALA conversion to EPA/DHA; ideal LA:ALA ratio ~4:1 (typical Western diet is 15–20:1) |
| **Zinc** | Cofactor for Δ6-desaturase; zinc deficiency reduces DGLA and AA synthesis from LA |
| **Vitamin B6** | PLP required for fatty acid desaturation/elongation steps |
| **Aspirin / NSAIDs** | Inhibit COX, reducing prostaglandin synthesis from AA — target of anti-inflammatory drugs downstream of LA pathway |
| **Corticosteroids** | Inhibit PLA2 → reduce AA release from membrane PL → broad suppression of AA-derived eicosanoids |
| **GLA supplements** | Increase DGLA; shifts AA:DGLA balance toward anti-inflammatory PGE1; theoretically synergistic with omega-3 EPA (both reduce pro-inflammatory AA eicosanoid output) |

## Supplementation Notes
- LA itself is **not typically supplemented** — it is over-abundant in the typical Western diet
- **GLA supplements (evening primrose oil, borage oil, black currant oil):** Used to bypass the rate-limiting Δ6-desaturation step; doses of 2–3 g/day GLA for inflammatory conditions; generally safe; may modestly increase AA production at very high doses — combining with EPA may mitigate this
- **CLA supplements (2–4 g/day):** Mixed evidence for body composition; *c9,t11-CLA* isomer considered safer than *t10,c12-CLA* (the latter linked to insulin resistance at high doses)
- **Reducing excess LA:** For those on seed oil–heavy diets, switching to olive oil (monosaturated), avocado oil, or reducing processed foods can substantially lower LA intake and improve omega-6:omega-3 balance
- **Skin applications:** LA-rich oils (rosehip oil, sunflower oil, evening primrose oil) topically applied improve acne-prone skin (acne lesions have low LA in surface sebum) and eczema (TEWL reduction)
