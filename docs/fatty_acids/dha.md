# Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) — Omega-3

## Overview
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a **long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA)** with 22 carbons and 6 double bonds in the *cis* configuration (22:6 n-3). It is the most structurally complex and functionally critical omega-3 in the human body — the **dominant structural lipid of the brain and retina**. DHA constitutes ~30–40% of total fatty acids in retinal photoreceptor membranes and ~15–20% of dry weight of the cerebral cortex. It is classified as conditionally essential: synthesised from ALA via the Sprecher pathway, but conversion is so inefficient (<1% of ALA→DHA) that preformed dietary DHA is effectively essential for adequate brain and retinal function, particularly during pregnancy, lactation, and infancy.

- **Classification:** Long-chain omega-3 PUFA; conditionally essential
- **IUPAC shorthand:** 22:6 (Δ4,7,10,13,16,19) or 22:6 n-3
- **Primary dietary source:** Marine fatty fish, microalgae (original producers)
- **Key characteristic:** Dominant structural lipid of the CNS and retina; essential for neurodevelopment; precursor to D-series resolvins and neuroprotectins

## Dietary Requirements

| Population | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| General adults | No official RDA; most authorities recommend 250–500 mg/day EPA+DHA |
| Pregnancy | **200–300 mg/day DHA** minimum (EFSA, WHO) |
| Lactation | 200–300 mg/day DHA; breast milk DHA content reflects maternal intake |
| Infants (0–12 months) | ~100 mg/day DHA (from breast milk/formula) |
| Vegans/Vegetarians | Algal DHA 200–400 mg/day recommended (no marine intake) |

> No established UL. High doses (>3 g/day EPA+DHA) may increase bleeding time. Doses used in clinical trials reach 2–4 g DHA/day without serious adverse effects.

## Functions

- **Structural lipid — brain (primary function):** DHA is the most abundant PUFA in the CNS. It is concentrated in the sn-2 position of phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in neuronal cell membranes, synaptic vesicle membranes, and myelin sheaths. DHA's unique structure (6 double bonds) imparts exceptional membrane fluidity and curvature, critical for synaptic transmission, receptor-coupled signalling (rhodopsin, GPCR), and vesicle fusion.
- **Structural lipid — retina:** DHA constitutes ~30–40% of fatty acids in photoreceptor outer segment membranes; essential for rhodopsin function and phototransduction cascade efficiency. Low DHA is associated with impaired dark adaptation and visual acuity.
- **Neurodevelopment:** DHA accumulates rapidly in fetal brain and retina during the third trimester and the first 2 years of postnatal life. Inadequate maternal DHA is associated with lower IQ, impaired visual acuity, and increased risk of ADHD in offspring. Critical "programmable" window cannot be compensated for later.
- **Neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) / Protectin D1:** DHA is the precursor to **neuroprotectin D1** (also called protectin D1) — a potent SPM (specialised pro-resolving mediator) that inhibits oxidative stress-induced neuronal apoptosis, reduces Aβ42 amyloid secretion, and protects against ischaemia-reperfusion injury.
- **D-series resolvins (RvD1–RvD6):** DHA → D-series resolvins (via aspirin-acetylated COX-2 or 15-LOX) → actively resolve inflammation; reduce neutrophil infiltration, promote macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.
- **Gene regulation (PPARγ, RXR):** DHA activates PPARγ and retinoid X receptor (RXR) — influences adipogenesis, insulin sensitisation, and anti-inflammatory gene expression.
- **Serotonin and dopamine modulation:** DHA influences serotonin receptor density and dopamine signalling in the prefrontal cortex (relevant in ADHD, depression, schizophrenia research).
- **Anti-arrhythmic:** Incorporated into cardiomyocyte membranes → modulates sodium and calcium channel kinetics → reduces cardiac arrhythmia risk (particularly ventricular fibrillation).
- **Triglyceride reduction:** DHA, like EPA, activates PPARα and inhibits DGAT → lowers plasma TG; DHA may raise LDL-C slightly more than EPA (clinically relevant difference primarily at pharmacological doses).

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Dietary absorption** | Absorbed in small intestine (as TG, PL or free FA) → chylomicrons → lymph → plasma |
| **Sprecher pathway (synthesis from EPA)** | EPA (20:5) → 22:5 n-3 (DPA; elongation) → 24:5 n-3 (elongation) → 24:6 n-3 (Δ6-desaturation; FADS2) → **DHA** (22:6; peroxisomal retroconversion/chain shortening); the rate-limiting Δ6-desaturation step is shared with ALA conversion — making ALA→DHA conversion very inefficient |
| **Phospholipid remodelling** | DHA preferentially incorporated at sn-2 position of PS and PE via Lands cycle; full membrane enrichment takes 4–8 weeks |
| **Retroconversion** | DHA → DPA (22:5 n-3) → EPA: a minor retroconversion pathway |
| **Peroxisomal β-oxidation** | Excess DHA and the 24:6 n-3 intermediate are processed in peroxisomes; peroxisomal function essential for DHA synthesis and metabolism |
| **Brain DHA dynamics** | Once in brain, DHA turnover is slow; brain preferentially takes up DHA via a specific transport system (MFSD2A transporter in blood-brain barrier endothelial cells) — essential for brain DHA retention |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | DHA (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Wild salmon (cooked) | 85 g | ~1,000–1,200 mg |
| Atlantic mackerel (cooked) | 85 g | ~900 mg |
| Herring (cooked) | 85 g | ~850 mg |
| Sardines (canned in oil) | 85 g | ~400–500 mg |
| Anchovies (canned) | 85 g | ~400 mg |
| Rainbow trout (farmed, cooked) | 85 g | ~700 mg |
| Tuna (canned light) | 85 g | ~180 mg |
| Algal oil supplement | 1 serving | ~200–400 mg |
| Eggs (DHA-enriched) | 1 large | ~100–150 mg |

> Plant foods contain virtually no DHA. Microalgae are the original producers — marine EPA/DHA enters the food chain via algae → zooplankton → small fish → large fish. Algal oil allows vegans to access preformed DHA directly from the biological source.

## Clinical Relevance

### Neurodevelopment and Pregnancy
- Maternal DHA deficiency during pregnancy is associated with lower offspring IQ (measured at 4 years), impaired visual development, and increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders.
- **DIAMOND trial and DINO trial:** DHA supplementation in infants and during lactation improves visual acuity and cognitive outcomes, particularly in preterm infants.
- DHA supplementation during pregnancy (600 mg/day; DORIS trial) reduced rate of early preterm birth (<34 weeks) by ~40% in women with low DHA status.
- **Recommendation:** Pregnant women should consume ≥200–300 mg/day DHA; if fish intake is limited, supplement with algal DHA.

### Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Decline
- Epidemiological studies consistently associate higher DHA intake/status with lower risk of dementia.
- **MFSD2A transporter:** Mutations in MFSD2A reduce brain DHA uptake → microcephaly and intellectual disability (rare); underscores DHA's structural necessity in the brain.
- **ADRN trial (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study):** DHA 2 g/day for 18 months did not slow decline in established Alzheimer's — suggesting DHA's role may be primarily preventive (structural) rather than therapeutic in advanced disease.
- DHA reduces Aβ peptide generation (via neuroprotectin D1) and tau hyperphosphorylation in animal models.

### ADHD
- Children with ADHD have consistently lower plasma DHA levels vs. controls.
- Supplementation trials (DHA 500–1,200 mg/day) show modest but statistically significant improvements in attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

### Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
- Higher dietary DHA+EPA associated with ~40% lower risk of advanced AMD (AREDS2 data).
- AREDS2 trial: Omega-3 (EPA+DHA) supplementation did not independently reduce AMD progression beyond the AREDS formula (lutein/zeaxanthin), but dietary EPA+DHA remained a protective association.

### DHA vs. EPA for Depression
- In contrast to EPA (which appears more active in MDD), DHA alone is less effective for depressive symptoms; combined EPA+DHA preparations with EPA predominance are preferred.

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **EPA** | Closely linked in metabolism and function; most benefits attributed to "EPA+DHA" — optimal ratios differ by clinical goal (higher EPA:DHA for inflammation/depression; DHA focus for cognition/neurodevelopment) |
| **Vitamin E** | Antioxidant protection against DHA peroxidation — DHA's 6 double bonds make it highly susceptible to lipid peroxidation; adequate vitamin E is critical with high PUFA diets |
| **Phosphatidylserine (PS)** | DHA is preferentially esterified in brain PS; PS supplements and DHA likely synergise for neurological function |
| **Choline** | Choline is the head group of PC (phosphatidylcholine) — DHA-enriched PC is the preferred delivery form for brain DHA; krill oil provides both DHA-PC and choline |
| **Vitamin D** | Synergistic in anti-inflammatory and neurodevelopmental contexts; share gene regulatory pathways |
| **Warfarin / Anticoagulants** | Mild additive anticoagulant effect at high doses; monitor INR |
| **Alcohol** | Promotes DHA peroxidation and disrupts brain DHA incorporation |
| **MFSD2A transporter** | Brain DHA uptake via MFSD2A is lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC-DHA) form dependent; DHA in phospholipid form (krill, LPC supplements) may have superior brain uptake |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Fish oil (EPA+DHA):** Most used omega-3 supplement globally; DHA content typically lower than EPA in standard fish oil (2:1 EPA:DHA); select products with specific DHA amounts
- **Algal DHA oil:** Recommended for vegans/vegetarians; growing evidence supports efficacy equivalent to fish oil; also appropriate during pregnancy (avoids potential fish mercury concern)
- **Krill oil:** DHA delivered as phospholipids → superior brain bioavailability; contains astaxanthin and choline; smaller doses required; more expensive per gram DHA
- **DHA-enriched eggs:** A practical, food-based way to increase DHA; from hens fed marine algae or flaxseed (not as high as fish)
- **During pregnancy:** Algal DHA 200–600 mg/day is safe, evidence-based, and avoids methyl-mercury concern
- **Storage:** DHA-rich oils highly susceptible to oxidation — store fish/algal oils refrigerated, consume promptly; check for off-smells indicating rancidity
- **Form bioavailability ranking:** rTG > krill phospholipid ≈ natural TG > ethyl ester (EE) when taken fasted; EE form approaches TG bioavailability when consumed with a fat-containing meal
