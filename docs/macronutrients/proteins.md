# Proteins

## Overview
Proteins are the most structurally diverse macronutrient, serving as the building blocks for virtually every functional and structural component in the body — from enzymes and hormones to immune antibodies and contractile muscle fibres. They are polymers of **amino acids** linked by peptide bonds, providing **4 kcal/gram**. Unlike carbohydrates and fats, the body has no dedicated protein storage depot — "stored" protein exists functionally (as muscle, organ tissue, enzymes), making adequate daily intake essential. Dietary protein quality depends on both amino acid composition (completeness) and digestibility.

- **Classification:** Macronutrient; 4 kcal/g
- **Building blocks:** 20 standard amino acids (9 essential, 7 conditionally essential, 4 non-essential)
- **Key roles:** Structural (collagen, actin, myosin), catalytic (enzymes), regulatory (hormones, receptors), immune (antibodies, complement), transport (haemoglobin, albumin), signalling (growth factors, cytokines)
- **Nitrogen balance:** Unique among macronutrients in containing nitrogen (~16% by mass); nitrogen balance is the index of protein adequacy

## Complete vs Incomplete Proteins

| Category | Definition | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Complete protein** | Provides all 9 essential amino acids in sufficient amounts relative to needs | Eggs, meat, poultry, fish, dairy, soy, quinoa, buckwheat |
| **Incomplete protein** | Low in one or more essential amino acids (limiting amino acid) | Most plant proteins: wheat (low Lys), rice (low Lys), legumes (low Met/Cys), corn (low Lys, Trp) |
| **Complementary proteins** | Two or more incomplete proteins that together supply all EAAs | Rice + legumes (classic combination); wheat + dairy |

> The concept of "protein combining at every meal" is outdated — the body maintains an amino acid pool; complementary proteins consumed within the same day are sufficient. However, whole-day adequacy of all EAAs matters.

## Protein Quality Metrics

| Metric | Description | Strengths / Weaknesses |
|---|---|---|
| **DIAAS** (Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score) | Score for each EAA: (digestible dietary AA / reference AA pattern) × 100; uses ileal digestibility | Current gold standard (WHO 2013); accounts for intestinal bacterial use of AA |
| **PDCAAS** (Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score) | Older version; uses faecal digestibility, scores capped at 1.0 | Can overestimate plant protein quality; being replaced by DIAAS |
| **BV (Biological Value)** | Proportion of absorbed nitrogen retained by the body | Measures utilisation, not digestibility; rarely used clinically now |

**High DIAAS foods (>100% = exceeds reference):** Eggs (~113), whey protein (~109), whole milk (~114), beef (~111)
**Moderate DIAAS:** Soy protein isolate (~98), pea protein (~75–82)
**Lower DIAAS:** Wheat (~40–45), rice (~59), most plant proteins

## Dietary Requirements

| Population | Protein Requirement |
|---|---|
| Adults (sedentary) | **0.8 g/kg/day** (RDA; minimum to prevent deficiency in 97.5% of population) |
| AMDR | **10–35% of total energy intake** |
| Older adults (>65 years) | **1.0–1.2 g/kg/day** (PROT-AGE recommendation); anabolic resistance requires higher EAA to stimulate MPS |
| Resistance training athletes | **1.6–2.2 g/kg/day** for muscle accretion (meta-analytic ceiling ~1.62 g/kg/day for MPS; higher intakes during caloric restriction may prevent muscle loss) |
| Endurance athletes | **1.2–1.6 g/kg/day** |
| Pregnancy | Add ~25 g/day above baseline (RDA ~1.1 g/kg/day) |
| Lactation | Add ~25 g/day above baseline |
| Critical illness / trauma | **1.2–2.0 g/kg/day** (ASPEN/SCCM guidelines) |

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Digestion — stomach** | Pepsinogen → pepsin (HCl activation); pepsin cleaves Phe, Tyr, Trp peptide bonds → polypeptides; denatures proteins (exposing peptide bonds) |
| **Digestion — small intestine** | Pancreatic proteases: trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase (endopeptidases); carboxypeptidases A and B (exopeptidases); brush-border peptidases → di/tripeptides and free AAs |
| **Absorption** | Free AAs: specific transporters (e.g., EAAT for acidic, CAT-1 for basic, SNAT for neutral AAs); Di/tripeptides: PepT1 cotransporter (H⁺-dependent) — **more efficient than free AA uptake** |
| **Amino acid pool** | Absorbed AAs → portal vein → liver → distributed to systemic AA pool; liver extracts ~60% of first-pass AAs for hepatic protein synthesis |
| **Muscle protein synthesis (MPS)** | Leucine is the primary anabolic signal → activates mTORC1 → phosphorylates S6K1 and 4E-BP1 → increased ribosomal translation of muscle proteins; ~3 g leucine per meal is the threshold dose |
| **Muscle protein breakdown (MPB)** | Ubiquitin-proteasome system (main); autophagy-lysosome pathway; regulated by insulin (suppresses MPB), IGF-1, testosterone, cortisol (promotes MPB during stress/fasting) |
| **Transamination** | Excess AAs: amino group transferred to α-keto acids (via ALT, AST); produces glutamate + new α-keto acid; carbon skeletons enter glycolysis or TCA |
| **Urea cycle** | Ammonia (toxic) → carbamoyl phosphate → citrulline → argininosuccinate → arginine → urea; urea excreted renally; requires adequate hydration |
| **Glucogenic vs ketogenic** | Glucogenic AAs (Ala, Gln, Asp, Pro, etc.): carbon skeletons → glucose precursors; Ketogenic AAs (Leu, Lys): → acetyl-CoA/acetoacetate → ketone bodies; Both (Phe, Tyr, Trp, Ile): yield both |

## Clinical Relevance

### Sarcopenia and Ageing
- Muscle mass peaks in the 3rd decade; loss accelerates after age 60 at ~1–2%/year. **Anabolic resistance** in older adults means more protein (and especially leucine) is needed per meal to achieve the same MPS response as younger adults.
- **Leucine threshold** rises in ageing — 0.4 g leucine per kg (vs ~0.24 g/kg in young adults) to maximally stimulate MPS.
- **Practical threshold:** 30–40 g high-quality protein per meal in older adults; 3–4 meals/day; combined with resistance exercise.

### Protein and Bone Health
- The "acid-ash hypothesis" (protein acidifies urine and leaches calcium from bones) is largely refuted. **Higher protein intakes are protective of bone density**, particularly in older adults (reduces risk of hip fracture).
- IGF-1 (stimulated by dietary protein) promotes osteoblast activity; calcium absorption from the gut is enhanced by protein.

### Kidney Disease
- In **established CKD (eGFR <30 mL/min without dialysis)**, protein restriction (0.6–0.8 g/kg/day) may slow progression by reducing urea load and glomerular hyperfiltration. Dietitian-supervised management required.
- **In dialysis patients**, protein requirements *increase* to 1.2–1.4 g/kg/day to compensate for dialysate losses.
- High protein intake **does not cause CKD** in healthy individuals with normal kidneys — epidemiological and RCT evidence does not support this concern in the absence of existing renal disease.

### Weight Management
- Protein has the highest **thermic effect of food (TEF)**: 20–30% of ingested protein energy is expended in digestion, absorption, and metabolism (vs ~5–10% for CHO, ~0–3% for fat).
- Protein is the most satiating macronutrient per calorie — increases GLP-1, PYY, CCK secretion; suppresses ghrelin.
- High-protein hypocaloric diets preferentially preserve lean mass during weight loss.

### Phenylketonuria (PKU)
- Autosomal recessive deficiency of **phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH)** → phenylalanine accumulates → neurotoxicity (intellectual disability, seizures).
- Management: lifelong low-phenylalanine diet + tyrosine supplementation (becomes essential); sapropterin (BH4 cofactor) for BH4-responsive PKU.

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Leucine** | Primary trigger of mTORC1-mediated MPS; 2.5–3 g leucine per meal recommended to maximise MPS (present in ~30 g whey or ~3 eggs) |
| **Carbohydrates (post-exercise)** | CHO + protein together post-exercise: CHO raises insulin (suppresses MPB) while protein supplies AAs (raises MPS); combined > either alone for net protein balance in initial recovery |
| **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)** | Cofactor for all aminotransferases (transamination) and amino acid decarboxylases; B6 requirement scales with protein intake (~0.016 mg per gram protein) |
| **Iron** | Animal protein enhances non-haem iron absorption (the "meat factor" / flesh factor); haem iron in meat is absorbed via separate pathway (HCP-1) independently of pH |
| **Zinc** | Phytate in plant proteins chelates zinc → lower bioavailability from plant sources; animal protein increases zinc absorption; protein intake correlates with zinc status |
| **Calcium** | Protein increases urinary calcium excretion (hypercalciuria) — historically misinterpreted as bone loss; net effect on bone is neutral to positive (protein raises IGF-1 and intestinal calcium absorption) |
| **Insulin / IGF-1** | Protein (especially BCAAs, Arg) stimulates insulin secretion; dietary protein correlates with IGF-1 — IGF-1 mediates anabolic effects on muscle and bone |
| **Kidney function (CKD)** | In CKD, restrict protein to reduce urea/creatinine load and slow progression; in dialysis, increase protein to compensate for losses |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Whey protein:** Derived from milk (cheese-making byproduct); fast-digesting (~90 min to peak plasma AA); highest DIAAS food protein; ideal post-exercise; ~24 g protein/30 g serve; contains β-lactoglobulin (high leucine), α-lactalbumin, lactoferrin
- **Casein protein:** Slow-digesting (clots in stomach → sustained AA release over 5–7 h); ideal pre-sleep protein (40 g casein pre-sleep increases overnight MPS in RCTs); lower leucine/g vs whey
- **Soy protein isolate:** Closest plant protein to animal protein in quality (DIAAS ~98); complete AA profile; contains isoflavones (weak oestrogen-like activity — not a clinical concern at food amounts)
- **Pea protein:** Popular vegan alternative; DIAAS ~75–82; low in Met/Cys; usually combined with rice protein to complete the AA profile; well tolerated
- **Creatine (related):** Not a protein supplement but supports protein synthesis indirectly by enhancing phosphocreatine resynthesis → more training volume → greater MPS stimulus
- **EAA/BCAA supplements:** Useful in clinical settings (pre/post-operative, cancer cachexia) or for those unable to meet protein targets through food; whole protein foods are superior for muscle-building in healthy individuals (contain micronutrients, phytonutrients, varied AAs)
- **Protein timing:** Post-exercise protein (within ~2 h) is beneficial; total daily protein intake is the strongest determinant of MPS over time; "anabolic window" is wider than once thought
