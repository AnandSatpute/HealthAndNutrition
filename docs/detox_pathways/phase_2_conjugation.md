# Phase II Conjugation

## Overview

Phase II reactions are **biosynthetic (conjugation) reactions** that attach large, polar, endogenous molecules to the reactive intermediates produced by Phase I (or directly to some parent compounds). The result is a large, highly water-soluble conjugate that can be readily excreted in bile or urine.

Phase II is generally considered **detoxifying** in the truest sense — it neutralises reactivity and flags compounds for elimination.

## The Six Major Phase II Conjugation Pathways

### 1. Glucuronidation (UGT Enzymes)

**The largest Phase II pathway by volume.**

- **Enzymes**: UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), 22 isoforms (UGT1A1–UGT2B28)
- **Cofactor**: UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA), derived from glucose → glucuronate
- **Location**: Liver (primary), intestinal epithelium, kidneys, brain
- **Functional groups conjugated**: –OH, –COOH, –NH₂, –SH

**Substrates glucuronidated:**

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Endogenous | Bilirubin, steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, bile acids |
| Drugs | Morphine, paracetamol, NSAIDs, valproic acid, lamotrigine |
| Xenobiotics | BPA, phthalates, environmental oestrogens |

**Enterohepatic Recirculation (EHC):**
Glucuronide conjugates excreted into bile can be cleaved by gut bacterial **β-glucuronidase**, releasing the free aglycone for reabsorption — a significant issue with oestrogen, bilirubin, and some drugs. Calcium D-glucarate and probiotic modulation can reduce β-glucuronidase activity.

**Key inducers**: Cruciferous vegetables (sulforaphane), St. John's Wort, rifampicin
**Key inhibitors/competitors**: High bilirubin load, alcohol, probenecid

### 2. Sulfation (SULT Enzymes)

- **Enzymes**: Sulfotransferases (SULTs), 13 cytosolic isoforms
- **Cofactor**: PAPS (3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate), synthesised from ATP + inorganic sulfate
- **Location**: Liver, intestinal mucosa, brain, adrenal glands, platelets
- **Functional groups**: –OH (phenols, alcohols), –NH₂, –NH

**Substrates sulfated:**

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Hormones | Oestrogens (E1-SO₄, E2-SO₄), DHEA-S, testosterone-S |
| Neurotransmitters | Dopamine sulphate, serotonin, adrenaline |
| Drugs | Paracetamol (minor pathway), minoxidil (activation step) |
| Dietary compounds | Quercetin, resveratrol, flavonoids |
| Thyroid | T4 → T4-sulfate (inactivation step) |

**Rate-limiting factor**: PAPS availability, which depends on **inorganic sulfate** (from dietary sulfur amino acids: cysteine, methionine, NAC, taurine; and MSM).

**Competition**: High phenol or oestrogenic load depletes PAPS rapidly → "sulfation saturation." Individuals with CBS gene variants may have reduced sulfate production.

### 3. Glutathione Conjugation (GST Enzymes)

- **Enzymes**: Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs, cytosolic and microsomal), multiple families (α, μ, θ, π, σ)
- **Cofactor**: Glutathione (GSH) — a tripeptide of glutamate + cysteine + glycine
- **Location**: Liver, kidneys, lungs, intestine, red blood cells

**Key reactions:**
- Nucleophilic attack of GSH on electrophilic substrates (epoxides, quinones, activated alkyl halides)
- Peroxidase activity (GSH peroxidase, GPx) — reduces H₂O₂ and lipid peroxides

**Critical substrates:**

| Substrate | Source |
|---|---|
| NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine) | Paracetamol overdose via CYP2E1 |
| Benzo[a]pyrene epoxides | Cigarette smoke, charred meat |
| Acrolein | Cigarette smoke, fried foods |
| 4-HNE (4-hydroxynonenal) | Lipid peroxidation product |
| Mercury, arsenic | Heavy metals (via MerB) |

**GSH regeneration cycle**: GSH (reduced) → GSSG (oxidised) → GSH (regenerated by glutathione reductase using NADPH). Selenium-dependent GPx is also part of this cycle.

**Depletion risk factors**: Malnutrition, chronic illness, heavy metal exposure, alcohol, ageing.

### 4. Methylation (COMT, TPMT, HNMT, GNMT)

See dedicated file: `methylation.md` for full detail.

- **Cofactor**: S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor
- **Enzymes**: Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), histamine methyltransferase (HNMT), others
- **Substrates**: Catecholamines, oestrogens, histamine, arsenic, heavy metals, drugs (6-mercaptopurine)

---

### 5. Acetylation (NAT1, NAT2)

- **Enzymes**: N-acetyltransferases (NAT1, NAT2)
- **Cofactor**: Acetyl-CoA
- **Location**: Liver, intestinal epithelium, red blood cells

**Genetic polymorphism — "acetylator status":**

| Phenotype | Frequency | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Fast acetylator | ~50% (varies by ethnicity) | Rapid drug clearance; may generate more carcinogenic arylamines |
| Slow acetylator | ~50% | Drugs accumulate; isoniazid → neuropathy; hydralazine → lupus-like syndrome |

**Key substrates**: Isoniazid, hydralazine, sulfonamides, procainamide, arylamines (carcinogens from cooked meat — heterocyclic amines).

### 6. Amino Acid Conjugation (Glycine, Taurine, Glutamine)

- **Enzymes**: Acyl-CoA ligases + aminoacyl transferases
- **Location**: Hepatic mitochondria (primarily)

**Substrates and conjugates:**

| Substrate | Amino Acid Used | Product |
|---|---|---|
| Benzoic acid | Glycine | Hippuric acid (urinary excretion) |
| Bile acids (chenodeoxycholic) | Glycine or Taurine | Glyco- or tauro-bile acids |
| Salicylate | Glycine | Salicyluric acid |
| Quinolinic acid | Glycine | Kynurenic acid (minor) |
| Phenylacetic acid | Glutamine | Phenylacetylglutamine |

Taurine conjugation of bile acids keeps bile acids in solution and prevents cholestasis. This pathway is limited by dietary **glycine** and **taurine** availability.

## Factors That Impair Phase II

| Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| Low-protein diet | Depletes amino acid conjugation substrates and GSH precursors |
| Selenium deficiency | Reduces GPx activity → oxidised glutathione accumulates |
| Magnesium deficiency | Impairs PAPS synthesis (sulfation) and UDP-glucuronate production |
| B12 / folate / B6 deficiency | Impairs SAM regeneration → methylation failure |
| Chronic alcohol | Depletes GSH, disrupts methylation, saturates glucuronidation |
| Gut dysbiosis | Elevated β-glucuronidase → EHC amplified |
| Genetic variants | GSTM1/GSTT1 null, UGT1A1*28 (Gilbert's), COMT V158M, NAT2 slow allele |
