# Phase I Biotransformation

## Overview

Phase I is the **first line of hepatic detoxification**. It chemically modifies lipophilic xenobiotics by introducing or unmasking a reactive polar functional group (–OH, –NH₂, –SH, –COOH), making the molecule slightly more water-soluble and, critically, creating a **"handle"** for Phase II conjugation enzymes.

> ⚠️ **Important caveat** — Phase I reactions can transiently produce *more toxic* reactive intermediates (e.g., epoxides, quinones, free radicals) than the parent compound. This is why Phase II capacity must keep pace with Phase I activity.

## The Cytochrome P450 Superfamily (CYP450)

The dominant Phase I enzymes are the **cytochrome P450 monooxygenases**, a superfamily of ~57 functional genes in humans. They are haem-containing proteins embedded in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (and inner mitochondrial membrane for some isoforms).

### Reaction Mechanism (Simplified)

```
Substrate (RH) + O₂ + NADPH + H⁺  →  Product (ROH) + H₂O + NADP⁺
```

The CYP450 iron centre cycles between Fe³⁺ and Fe²⁺, binding molecular oxygen and donating one oxygen atom to the substrate while reducing the other to water.

### Major Isoforms and Their Substrates

| Isoform | Abundance (liver) | Key Substrates / Inducers / Inhibitors |
|---|---|---|
| **CYP1A1** | Low (inducible) | PAHs from grilled food, cigarette smoke · Induced by cruciferous vegetables (indole-3-carbinol), charred meat |
| **CYP1A2** | ~13% of total | Caffeine, melatonin, theophylline · Induced by smoking · Inhibited by fluvoxamine |
| **CYP2B6** | ~3% | Bupropion, efavirenz, cyclophosphamide |
| **CYP2C9** | ~20% | Warfarin, ibuprofen, phenytoin · Polymorphic (poor metabolisers at higher bleeding risk) |
| **CYP2C19** | ~7% | Omeprazole, clopidogrel, diazepam · *Poor metaboliser* allele common in East Asians (~20%) |
| **CYP2D6** | ~3% but critical | Codeine → morphine, metoprolol, tramadol · Ultra-rapid metabolisers at overdose risk |
| **CYP2E1** | ~7% | Ethanol, acetaminophen, benzene, CCl₄ · Induced by fasting, alcohol · Generates ROS and NAPQI |
| **CYP3A4/5** | ~40% | Statins, cyclosporine, testosterone, cortisol, >50% of all drugs · Induced by St. John's wort, rifampicin |

### Genetic Polymorphisms

CYP450 genes are *highly polymorphic*. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) categorise individuals as:

- **Poor metabolisers (PM)** — reduced or absent enzyme activity; drug accumulates
- **Intermediate metabolisers (IM)** — one functional allele
- **Extensive metabolisers (EM)** — normal
- **Ultra-rapid metabolisers (UM)** — multiple gene copies; drug cleared too fast

## Types of Phase I Reactions

### 1. Oxidation (Most Common)

| Reaction Type | Example |
|---|---|
| Aliphatic hydroxylation | Testosterone → androstanediol |
| Aromatic hydroxylation | Benzene → phenol |
| N-oxidation | Trimethylamine → TMAO |
| S-oxidation | Dimethyl sulfoxide → DMSO |
| Epoxidation | Benzo[a]pyrene → benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-epoxide (carcinogenic) |
| Dealkylation (N-, O-, S-) | Codeine → morphine (O-demethylation via CYP2D6) |

### 2. Reduction

Less common; occurs under low-oxygen (anaerobic) conditions:

- **Nitroreduction** — Metronidazole activated to toxic radical anion
- **Azo-reduction** — Gut microbiome reduces azo dyes (e.g., tartrazine)
- **Carbonyl reduction** — Ketones → secondary alcohols via carbonyl reductases

### 3. Hydrolysis

Esterases and amidases cleave ester and amide bonds:

- Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) → salicylic acid (plasma esterases)
- Cocaine → benzoylecgonine (pseudo-cholinesterase)
- Procaine → PABA + diethylaminoethanol

## Key Cofactors and Nutrients Required

| Nutrient | Role in Phase I |
|---|---|
| **Iron** | Core of haem in CYP450 active site |
| **Magnesium** | CYP450 electron transport support |
| **Riboflavin (B2)** | FAD cofactor for NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase |
| **Niacin (B3)** | NADPH production via pentose phosphate pathway |
| **Copper** | Cytochrome oxidase, antioxidant defence |
| **Zinc** | CYP450 protein structure |
| **Molybdenum** | Aldehyde oxidase (Phase I xanthine oxidase family) |
| **Antioxidants** | Buffer ROS produced during CYP450 cycling |

## Flavonoids and CYP450 Interaction

Many dietary phytochemicals modulate CYP450:

| Phytochemical | Effect |
|---|---|
| Grapefruit furanocoumarins | **Irreversibly inhibit CYP3A4** (major drug interaction risk) |
| Indole-3-carbinol (cruciferous) | Induces CYP1A1/1A2 |
| Quercetin | Inhibits CYP3A4, CYP2C9 |
| Curcumin | Inhibits CYP1A2; variable effect on CYP3A4 |
| Resveratrol | Inhibits CYP1B1 |
| St. John's Wort | Strong CYP3A4 inducer (clinically significant) |

---

## Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Production

The CYP450 catalytic cycle is inherently "leaky" — oxygen can escape as superoxide (O₂•⁻) rather than being used for hydroxylation. This **oxidative uncoupling** is exacerbated by:

- Alcohol consumption (CYP2E1 is especially ROS-prone)
- Xenobiotic overload
- Nutrient deficiencies (inadequate antioxidants)

Resulting ROS can damage:
- Mitochondrial DNA
- Lipid membranes (lipid peroxidation)
- Proteins (carbonylation)
- Phase II enzyme capacity itself

## Clinical Relevance

| Scenario | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity | CYP2E1 converts paracetamol → NAPQI, depletes glutathione |
| Alcohol-drug interactions | Ethanol inhibits CYP2E1 acutely; chronic use induces it |
| Grapefruit warnings on statins | CYP3A4 inhibition → statin accumulation → myopathy |
| Slow acetylator phenotype (NAT2) | Isoniazid accumulates → peripheral neuropathy |
| Codeine in CYP2D6 ultra-metabolisers | Rapid conversion to morphine → overdose in children |
