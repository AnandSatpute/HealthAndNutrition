# Phase III — Transport & Excretion

## Overview

Phase III is the **final step in hepatic detoxification**: the active transport of Phase II conjugates (and some Phase I intermediates) out of hepatocytes into bile canaliculi, or out of renal tubular cells into urine, for elimination from the body.

Without efficient Phase III transport, water-soluble conjugates would accumulate inside cells and cause toxicity despite having undergone Phase II modification.

## Transporters Involved

Phase III relies on **ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters** — a superfamily of active, energy-dependent efflux pumps. They operate against concentration gradients, using ATP hydrolysis.

### Key Efflux Transporters

| Transporter | Gene | Location | Primary Substrates |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MRP2** (ABCC2) | *ABCC2* | Hepatocyte canalicular membrane, kidney, intestine | Glucuronides, glutathione conjugates, sulphate conjugates, bilirubin diglucuronide |
| **P-glycoprotein** (P-gp, MDR1) | *ABCB1* | Hepatocyte, intestinal epithelium, BBB, kidney | Hydrophobic drugs, steroids, xenobiotics (prevents brain entry) |
| **BCRP** (MXR) | *ABCG2* | Liver, intestine, mammary gland, placenta | Sulphate conjugates, folate, drugs (imatinib, methotrexate) |
| **MRP3** (ABCC3) | *ABCC3* | Basolateral (sinusoidal) hepatocyte | Glucuronides, bile acids (efflux to sinusoid → blood → kidney) |
| **BSEP** | *ABCB11* | Canalicular membrane | Bile salts (primary bile acid secretion) |
| **OAT1/3** | SLC22A family | Renal proximal tubule | Glucuronides, organic anions (Phase II products from bloodstream → urine) |

## Routes of Elimination

### 1. Biliary Excretion (→ Faeces)

Large conjugates (MW > ~500 Da) are preferentially excreted into bile via **MRP2** and then travel to the duodenum. Gut flora can:

- **Deconjugate** them (via β-glucuronidase) → enterohepatic recirculation (EHC) → reabsorption
- **Further transform** them (e.g., bile acid modification by *Bacteroides*, *Clostridium*)
- **Excrete** them intact in faeces (if deconjugation is suppressed)

**Compounds primarily eliminated via bile:**
- Bilirubin diglucuronide
- Large drug glucuronides (morphine-6G)
- Heavy metal complexes
- Steroid sulphates and glucuronides

### 2. Renal Excretion (→ Urine)

Smaller conjugates (MW < ~300–500 Da) return to the bloodstream via basolateral transporters (MRP3, MRP4) and are filtered at the kidney glomerulus or actively secreted by renal tubular OAT transporters.

**Compounds primarily eliminated via urine:**
- Paracetamol glucuronide and sulfate
- Hippuric acid (glycine conjugate of benzoate)
- Many drug metabolites
- Water-soluble heavy metal chelates

### 3. Pulmonary Excretion

Volatile compounds diffuse across the alveolar membrane into exhaled air:

- **Ethanol** (~5% exhaled — basis of breathalyser)
- **Acetone** (elevated in ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis)
- **Acetaldehyde** (intermediate of ethanol metabolism)
- **Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)** from industrial exposure

### 4. Skin / Sweat

Minor pathway for:
- **Heavy metals**: arsenic, mercury, cadmium (detectable in sweat research)
- **BPA** (bisphenol A)
- **Urea** and small nitrogenous waste

Saunas may modestly increase elimination of lipophilic xenobiotics through sweat and sebum, though the evidence is limited.

**Clinically problematic EHC** occurs with:
- **Oestrogens**: Deconjugated E1/E2 re-enter circulation → higher oestrogen exposure
- **Bilirubin**: Neonatal jaundice management requires interrupting EHC (phototherapy, cholestyramine)
- **Morphine-6-glucuronide**: Prolonged opioid effect
- **NSAIDs**: GI toxicity partly from EHC of NSAID acyl glucuronides

**Strategies to reduce EHC:**
- Dietary fibre → binds deconjugated compounds in gut
- Calcium D-glucarate → inhibits β-glucuronidase enzyme
- Probiotic strains that downregulate β-glucuronidase (*L. acidophilus*, *B. longum*)

## Genetic Variants Affecting Phase III

| Gene | Variant | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| *ABCC2* | c.3972C>T, c.-24C>T | Reduced MRP2 → impaired bilirubin and drug conjugate excretion → Dubin–Johnson syndrome (homozygous null) |
| *ABCB1* | C3435T | Altered P-gp expression/function; affects drug bioavailability |
| *ABCG2* | Q141K | Reduced BCRP → increased plasma drug levels (rosuvastatin, gout risk from elevated urate) |
| *ABCB11* | Various | BSEP deficiency → progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (PFIC2) |
