# HPA Axis (Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal Axis)

## Overview

The HPA axis is the **central neuroendocrine stress-response system**, coordinating the brain's perception of threat with the body's hormonal readiness to cope. Its primary output — **cortisol** — affects virtually every organ system: metabolism, immune function, memory, mood, and inflammation.

> **Key insight** — Cortisol is not inherently harmful. Short pulses are essential for survival. It is **chronic, tonically elevated cortisol** that depletes nutrients, shrinks the hippocampus, suppresses immunity, and dysregulates mood.

### Diurnal Cortisol Rhythm

| Time | Cortisol Level | Function |
|---|---|---|
| **06:00–08:00** | Peak (CAR — Cortisol Awakening Response) | Mobilises glucose; primes immune system |
| **08:00–12:00** | Declining plateau | Supports alertness, focus |
| **12:00–20:00** | Gradual fall | Activity tolerance |
| **20:00–02:00** | Nadir | Tissue repair; immune surveillance |
| **02:00–06:00** | Rising (pre-dawn surge) | Preparation for awakening |

## Cortisol Synthesis — Nutrient Requirements

Cortisol is a steroid derived from **cholesterol** through a multi-enzyme cascade in the adrenal cortex.

| Step | Enzyme | Nutrient Cofactor | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cholesterol → Pregnenolone | **StAR + CYP11A1** (P450scc) | Vitamin C, Fe²⁺ | Rate-limiting; mitochondrial |
| Pregnenolone → Progesterone | **3β-HSD** | DHEA as substrate side-product | — |
| Progesterone → 17-OH-Progesterone | **CYP17A1** | — | Also makes androgens |
| → 11-Deoxycortisol | **CYP21A2** | — | — |
| 11-Deoxycortisol → **Cortisol** | **CYP11B1** | **Vitamin C** (essential for adrenal CYP enzymes), **Fe²⁺** | Highest Vitamin C concentration in body is in adrenal glands |

### Vitamin C and the Adrenals
The adrenal gland has the **highest concentration of vitamin C** in the body (~30× plasma). Vitamin C:
- Protects adrenal CYP450 enzymes from oxidative damage
- Required for catecholamine synthesis (DBH: dopamine → norepinephrine → epinephrine)
- Depleted rapidly during acute stress (ACTH stimulates Vit C release from adrenals)

## Cortisol's Systemic Effects

| System | Acute Effect (adaptive) | Chronic Effect (pathological) |
|---|---|---|
| **Metabolism** | Gluconeogenesis ↑, lipolysis ↑ | Insulin resistance, visceral fat accumulation, muscle wasting |
| **Immune** | Anti-inflammatory (transient) | Immunosuppression; impaired NK cells and TH1 response |
| **Brain** | Hippocampal LTP (memory consolidation) | Hippocampal dendrite retraction; BDNF ↓; memory impairment |
| **Cardiovascular** | BP ↑, HR ↑ | Hypertension, endothelial damage |
| **Gut** | Reduces gut motility | IBS, intestinal permeability ↑ (leaky gut) |
| **Reproductive** | — | Suppresses LH/FSH → low testosterone/estrogen |

## Stress-Induced Nutrient Depletion

Chronic HPA activation creates a **vicious nutritional cycle**: stress depletes nutrients → nutrient depletion worsens stress resilience → amplified HPA response.

| Nutrient | Mechanism of Depletion | Consequence of Deficiency |
|---|---|---|
| **Vitamin C** | Rapid adrenal release during ACTH stimulation | Impaired cortisol synthesis; collagen breakdown |
| **Magnesium** | Excreted by kidneys under adrenergic stimulation; also COMT is Mg-dependent | Hyperexcitability, poor sleep, COMT impairment |
| **Zinc** | Stress-induced metallothionein = sequesters Zn away from immune/enzymatic functions | Immune suppression, reduced BDNF, impaired 5α-reductase |
| **B5 (Pantothenate)** | Direct precursor to **CoA** (required for acetyl-CoA in adrenal steroidogenesis) | Adrenal fatigue, impaired cortisol synthesis; also required for melatonin production |
| **B6 (Pyridoxal-5′-phosphate)** | Cortisol degrades PLP; glucocorticoids inhibit PLP-dependent enzymes | Serotonin/dopamine synthesis impaired (AADC requires PLP) |
| **Vitamin D** | Stress-induced inflammation reduces VDR expression; also dietary neglect | Immune dysregulation, reduced serotonin synthesis |
| **Iron** | Chronic inflammation sequesters iron (hepcidin ↑) | Fatigue, cognitive impairment, reduced CYP activity |
| **B12 and Folate** | Methylation demand increases under stress (cortisol → epinephrine conversion via PNMT requires SAM) | Elevated homocysteine, impaired methylation |

## Adrenal Recovery — Nutritional Protocols

> **Note on "Adrenal Fatigue":** Not a validated medical diagnosis, but HPA axis dysregulation (attenuated cortisol rhythm, blunted CAR, raised basal evening cortisol) is documented in burnout and chronic stress. Treatment centres on reducing allostatic load and restoring depleted nutrients.

### Priority Nutrients

| Nutrient | Dose Range (therapeutic) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Vitamin C** | 500–2000 mg/day (divided) | Adrenal support; antioxidant; blunts cortisol response to exercise in studies |
| **Pantothenic Acid (B5)** | 500–1500 mg/day | CoA synthesis; required for ALL steroid hormone production |
| **Magnesium glycinate / threonate** | 200–400 mg elemental/day | HPA dampening; sleep quality; COMT support |
| **Ashwagandha (KSM-66)** | 300–600 mg/day (extract) | Cortisol reduction in RCTs; adaptogen acting on HPA feedback |
| **Rhodiola rosea** | 200–400 mg/day (standardised) | Mild MAO inhibition; cortisol blunting; reduces adrenal sensitisation |
| **Phosphatidylserine** | 400–800 mg/day | Blunts ACTH and cortisol response to exercise stress (consistent RCT data) |
| **Zinc** | 15–30 mg/day | Restores thymulin, BDNF; supports CYP enzyme stability |
| **Vitamin D3 + K2** | 2000–5000 IU/day | Restores VDR; anti-inflammatory; adrenal cortex VDR binding |
| **Adaptogenic B-complex** | Full spectrum (B1–B12) | Restore PLP; support methylation; catecholamine synthesis |

## Key Hormones and Distinctions

| Hormone | Source | Primary Trigger | Half-life | Key Function |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CRH** | Hypothalamus (PVN) | Perceived threat, inflammation, hypoglycaemia | ~90 min | Releases ACTH |
| **ACTH** | Anterior pituitary | CRH | ~10 min | Stimulates cortisol synthesis |
| **Cortisol** | Adrenal cortex (zona fasciculata) | ACTH | ~60–100 min | Glucocorticoid effector |
| **DHEA / DHEA-S** | Adrenal cortex (zona reticularis) | ACTH | 7–10 hrs (DHEA-S) | Counter-regulates cortisol; neurosteroid; androgen precursor |
| **Aldosterone** | Adrenal cortex (zona glomerulosa) | Angiotensin II, low Na⁺ | ~20 min | Na⁺/K⁺ balance; BP regulation |
| **Adrenaline (Epinephrine)** | Adrenal medulla | Sympathetic (fast) | ~2–3 min | Acute fight-or-flight; heart rate |

## HPA Axis and Neurotransmitters

The HPA axis does not operate in isolation — it is tightly modulated by key neurotransmitter systems:

| Neurotransmitter | Effect on HPA |
|---|---|
| **Serotonin** | 5-HT₁A → inhibits CRH; 5-HT₂ → stimulates. Net: tonic inhibitory. Low serotonin = disinhibited HPA |
| **GABA** | Inhibitory tone on hypothalamic CRH neurons; reduced GABA → amplified stress response |
| **Dopamine** | Inhibits ACTH release; low dopamine states → dysregulated cortisol |
| **Norepinephrine** | Stimulates CRH (α₁ receptor); locus coeruleus → HPA activation in acute stress |
| **Glutamate / NMDA** | Activates PVN CRH neurons; excitotoxic loop in chronic stress |
| **Acetylcholine** | Muscarinic → stimulates CRH; nicotine chronically dysregulates HPA rhythm |

---

## Negative Feedback Failure

In **chronic stress**, the negative feedback loop deteriorates due to:

1. **Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) downregulation** — prolonged cortisol reduces GR expression in hippocampus and hypothalamus → less feedback sensitivity
2. **Hippocampal atrophy** — hippocampus normally suppresses PVN; dendrite retraction = loss of inhibitory tone
3. **CRH hypersecretion** — CRH neurons in bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) bypass normal feedback circuits

> Restoration requires both **nutrient repletion** (above) and **stimulus removal** — sleep, down-regulation of perceived threat (CBT, mindfulness have demonstrated GR normalisation in studies).

|---|---|---|
| **Anxiety / panic disorder** | Hyperactive HPA | Elevated baseline CRH; morning cortisol spike during panic attacks |
| **Major depression** | Hyperactive HPA (melancholic) or blunted (atypical) | Dexamethasone non-suppression test classically positive in melancholic type |
| **PTSD** | Blunted HPA + hypersensitive amygdala | Low cortisol paradox; glucocorticoid receptor hypersensitivity |
| **Burnout / chronic fatigue** | Hypocortisol (HPA exhaustion) | Flat diurnal curve; poor CAR; depleted B5, Mg, C |
| **Cushing's syndrome** | Chronic hypercortisolaemia | Central obesity, muscle wasting, immunosuppression, osteoporosis |
| **Addison's disease** | Adrenal insufficiency | Low cortisol + aldosterone; medical emergency |
| **Metabolic syndrome** | Elevated cortisol → insulin resistance | Visceral fat, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia |
