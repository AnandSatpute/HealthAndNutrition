# Deficiency Index — Symptom → Likely Deficiency

A quick-reference lookup table: start with a symptom or sign and find the likely nutrient deficiencies to investigate. Organised by body system.

> **Usage note:** Deficiency symptoms are rarely pathognomonic — multiple deficiencies often coexist, and symptoms overlap with non-nutritional causes. Use this as a starting point, not a diagnostic tool.
