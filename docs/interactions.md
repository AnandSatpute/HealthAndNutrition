# Nutrient Interactions — Synergies & Antagonisms

A reference for how nutrients enhance or inhibit each other's absorption, metabolism, and function.  
Knowing these relationships is essential for optimising supplementation timing and food combinations.

> **Key:** ✅ Synergy (beneficial co-administration) · ⛔ Antagonism (harmful, avoid co-administration) · ⚠️ Context-dependent

## Absorption Interactions (At Time of Ingestion)

### Vitamins

| Interaction | Type | Mechanism | Practical Guidance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Vitamin C + Iron (non-haem)** | ✅ Synergy | C reduces Fe³⁺ → Fe²⁺ (the absorbable form); also forms soluble chelate in intestine | Take vitamin C with iron-rich plant meals; e.g., orange juice with lentils |
| **Vitamin D + Calcium** | ✅ Synergy | 1,25(OH)₂D₃ upregulates TRPV6 channel and calbindin-D → active Ca²⁺ absorption in duodenum | Supplement calcium and D together; D deficiency makes Ca supplementation largely ineffective |
| **Vitamin D + Magnesium** | ✅ Synergy | Magnesium is required for all vitamin D hydroxylation steps (25-hydroxylase and 1α-hydroxylase) | Concurrent Mg supplementation required for D activation; Mg deficiency makes high-dose D ineffective |
| **Vitamin D + K2** | ✅ Synergy | D increases calcium absorption; K2 (MK-7) activates osteocalcin to incorporate Ca into bone matrix and activates Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) to prevent arterial calcification | Co-administer D3 + K2 to direct calcium appropriately |
| **Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) + Dietary Fat** | ✅ Synergy | Fat-soluble vitamins require bile salt-facilitated micelle formation for absorption | Always consume fat-soluble vitamins with a fat-containing meal |
| **Vitamin A + Zinc** | ✅ Synergy | Zinc required for synthesis of retinol-binding protein (RBP) — the transport protein for Vitamin A | Zinc deficiency can cause functional vitamin A deficiency even with adequate A intake |
| **Vitamin E + Vitamin C** | ✅ Synergy | Vitamin C regenerates oxidised (radical) Vitamin E (tocopheroxyl radical → tocopherol) | Protective synergy — both are antioxidants operating at different compartments |
| **Beta-carotene + Fat** | ✅ Synergy | Carotenoid absorption requires lipid-rich micelles | Add fat to carotene-rich meals (e.g., olive oil to cooked carrots) |
| **Vitamin K1 vs K2** | ⚠️ Context | K1 (phylloquinone) primarily reaches liver for clotting factors; K2 (menaquinone) reaches peripheral tissues (bone, artery). They are not equivalent. | For bone/cardiovascular benefit, specifically target K2 (MK-7 from natto/supplements) |
| **Vitamin B12 + Folate (B9)** | ✅ Synergy | B12 is required to regenerate methyltetrahydrofolate (active folate) from the methylfolate trap; both required for homocysteine remethylation | Supplementing folate without B12 can mask B12 deficiency while neurological damage progresses |

### Minerals

| Interaction | Type | Mechanism | Practical Guidance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Calcium vs Iron** | ⛔ Antagonism | Ca²⁺ competitively inhibits both haem and non-haem iron absorption at shared transporter (DMT1) | Do not take calcium supplements with iron-rich meals or iron supplements |
| **Calcium vs Zinc** | ⛔ Antagonism | High calcium intake decreases zinc absorption; both compete at intestinal level | High-dose Ca supplements can worsen zinc status |
| **Calcium vs Magnesium** | ⛔ Antagonism (high doses) | At very high doses, Ca and Mg compete for shared transporters. At normal dietary intakes, they are somewhat interdependent. | Ratio Ca:Mg ~2:1 generally recommended; avoid very high Ca without matching Mg |
| **Zinc vs Copper** | ⛔ Antagonism | High zinc induces metallothionein in intestinal cells, which preferentially sequesters copper → copper deficiency | Long-term zinc supplementation (>40 mg/day) should include 1–2 mg copper; therapeutic use of high zinc (Wilson's disease) intentionally uses this mechanism |
| **Iron vs Zinc** | ⛔ Antagonism | Competitive absorption at DMT1 | Separate iron and zinc supplements by 2+ hours |
| **Iron vs Calcium** | ⛔ Antagonism (see above) | — | — |
| **Iron vs Manganese** | ⛔ Antagonism | Both share DMT1 transporter | Iron deficiency increases manganese absorption; excess manganese in iron-deficient children is a toxicity concern |
| **Magnesium + Potassium** | ✅ Synergy | Magnesium is required for Na/K-ATPase activity; Mg deficiency impairs the ability to restore intracellular potassium → refractory hypokalaemia | In hospitalised patients, hypokalaemia not responding to K supplementation should prompt checking Mg status |
| **Selenium + Iodine** | ✅ Synergy | Selenium (as selenocysteine) is the active site of iodothyronine deiodinase, which converts T4 → T3. Selenium also protects thyroid from H₂O₂ damage during thyroid hormone synthesis | Correct selenium deficiency alongside iodine deficiency; selenium alone without iodine can worsen autoimmune thyroiditis |
| **Iron + Hepcidin (inflammation)** | ⚠️ Context | Inflammation raises hepcidin → blocks ferroportin → traps iron in reticuloendothelial cells → anaemia of chronic disease. Oral iron is ineffective in active inflammation. | IV iron bypasses hepcidin block; oral iron ineffective when CRP is high |
| **Oxalate vs Calcium, Iron, Magnesium** | ⛔ Antagonism | Oxalate forms insoluble complexes with Ca²⁺, Fe²⁺, Mg²⁺ → greatly reduces absorption | High-oxalate foods (spinach, beet greens, rhubarb) are poor sources of calcium and iron; pair with low-oxalate sources |
| **Phytate vs Iron, Zinc, Calcium, Mg** | ⛔ Antagonism | Phytic acid (inositol hexaphosphate) chelates divalent cations → reduced absorption from legumes, grains | Soaking, sprouting, fermenting, and cooking degrades phytate and significantly improves mineral bioavailability |
| **Tannins (tea/coffee) vs Iron** | ⛔ Antagonism | Polyphenolic tannins form insoluble complexes with non-haem iron | Do not drink tea or coffee within 1 hour of an iron-rich meal or iron supplement |

## Metabolic Partnerships (Functional Synergies)

These interactions occur at the level of metabolism rather than absorption.

| Nutrients | Relationship | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **B1 + B2 + B3 + B5 + Mg** | ✅ Team | All required for the TCA cycle / energy metabolism (pyruvate decarboxylase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, etc.) | Deficiency of any one limits energy production |
| **B6 + B9 + B12** | ✅ Team | One-carbon (methyl) metabolism / methylation cycle; homocysteine remethylation requires all three | Elevated homocysteine → cardiovascular disease, neurological dysfunction |
| **B12 + Intrinsic Factor (IF)** | ✅ Dependency | Without gastric parietal cell-derived IF, oral B12 requires massive doses for passive absorption (~1% of dose) | Patients with pernicious anaemia (autoimmune IF deficiency) or gastrectomy need B12 injection or high-dose oral supplement |
| **Tryptophan + B6 + B3** | ✅ Dependency | B6 (as PLP) is required for conversion of tryptophan → niacin (kynurenine pathway, 60 mg Trp → ~1 mg niacin) | B6 deficiency diverts Trp metabolism and can worsen niacin status |
| **Vitamin C + Iron (metabolic)** | ✅ Synergy | C is required as a cofactor for prolyl/lysyl hydroxylases (collagen cross-linking) — independently of absorption enhancement | Scurvy: defective collagen despite adequate dietary protein |
| **Selenium + Glutathione + Vitamin E** | ✅ Team | Selenium is the active site of Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx); E is the membrane-phase antioxidant; glutathione is the primary intracellular antioxidant | Operating in series: E quenches lipid radicals → GPx reduces lipid hydroperoxides |
| **Creatine + Carbohydrate (post-exercise)** | ✅ Synergy | Insulin stimulates muscle creatine transporter (SLC6A8) — carbohydrate co-ingestion enhances creatine uptake into muscle | Creatine + carbs > creatine alone for muscle loading |
| **Beta-alanine → Carnosine (with Histidine)** | ✅ Dependency | Carnosine = Beta-alanine + Histidine; beta-alanine is rate-limiting in muscle; histidine availability also matters | Both precursors needed for carnosine synthesis; beta-alanine is typically the limiting factor |
| **L-Carnitine (Lysine + Methionine + C + B6 + Fe + Niacin)** | ✅ Team | Carnitine biosynthesis requires Lysine, Methionine, Ascorbate (C), B6, Fe²⁺, and niacin as cofactors | Dietary carnitine need is low in omnivores; vegans may rely on endogenous synthesis |
| **CoQ10 + Selenium + Vitamin E** | ✅ Team | CoQ10 is regenerated from ubiquinol (reduced) to ubiquinone by Vitamin E and GPx (selenium) | All three together form mitochondrial antioxidant network |
| **Omega-3 (EPA/DHA) + Vitamin E** | ✅ Synergy | PUFAs are highly susceptible to lipid peroxidation; Vitamin E protects cell membranes from oxidative damage | High Omega-3 supplementation increases Vitamin E requirement |
| **Glucosinolates + Myrosinase** | ✅ Dependency | Glucosinolates (in cruciferous vegetables) are only converted to bioactive isothiocyanates (e.g., sulforaphane) by the enzyme myrosinase, which is destroyed by heat | Eat some raw cruciferous (e.g., mustard seeds as exogenous myrosinase source alongside cooked broccoli) |
| **Curcumin + Piperine** | ✅ Synergy | Piperine inhibits CYP1A2/CYP3A4 and glucuronidation (Phase II metabolism) → bioavailability of curcumin increases ~20-fold | Always combine turmeric with black pepper and fat |
| **Probiotics + Prebiotics (= Synbiotics)** | ✅ Synergy | Prebiotics (FOS, inulin, pectin) provide fermentable substrate for probiotic bacteria, enhancing their colonisation and effect | Combining Lactobacillus/Bifidobacterium with inulin or FOS = synbiotic strategy |

## Drug–Nutrient Interactions

> These interactions are clinically significant. Cross-reference with individual mineral/vitamin notes.

### Nutrient Levels Reduced by Drugs

| Drug | Nutrient Depleted | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Metformin** | B12 (significant), B9 | Impairs ileal B12-IF complex absorption; reduces methylation |
| **Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)** | B12, Magnesium, Iron, Zinc, Calcium | Reduced gastric acid → impaired absorption of acid-dependent nutrients |
| **H2 Blockers (ranitidine, famotidine)** | B12 | Reduced acid production reduces IF-mediated B12 absorption |
| **Oral Contraceptive Pill (OCP)** | B6, B9, B12, Riboflavin (B2), C, Zinc, Magnesium | Estrogen affects B-vitamin metabolism |
| **Corticosteroids (long-term)** | Calcium, Vitamin D, Zinc, B6, K | Induce renal Ca wasting; impair intestinal Ca absorption |
| **Cholestyramine / Colestipol (bile acid sequestrants)** | Vitamins A, D, E, K, Beta-carotene, B12 | Bind bile acids → impair fat-soluble vitamin absorption |
| **Loop diuretics (furosemide)** | Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium, Thiamine (B1), Zinc | Increase urinary excretion of divalent cations |
| **Thiazide diuretics** | Potassium, Magnesium, Zinc | Increase K⁺ and Mg²⁺ excretion; *decrease* Ca excretion → hypercalcaemia risk |
| **Antiepileptics (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine)** | Vitamin D, B9, B6, B12, K | Induce CYP enzymes → accelerated catabolism of D and B vitamins |
| **Isoniazid (INH — TB drug)** | B6 (Pyridoxine) | INH is a B6 antagonist — classic cause of drug-induced B6 deficiency neuropathy |
| **Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors)** | CoQ10 | Block mevalonate pathway → CoQ10 synthesis (same pathway as cholesterol) |
| **Methotrexate** | B9 (Folate) | Folic acid antagonist — inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) |
| **Trimethoprim (antibiotic)** | B9 (Folate) | Also DHFR inhibitor; folate supplementation may be needed |

### Nutrients That Affect Drug Efficacy

| Nutrient / Food | Drug Affected | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Vitamin K (high K1 foods)** | Warfarin / Acenocoumarol | K1 reverses anticoagulant effect — maintain consistent K1 intake; do not rapidly change dietary K1 |
| **Calcium** | Fluoroquinolones, Tetracyclines, Levothyroxine, Bisphosphonates | Forms insoluble chelate/complex → significantly reduced drug absorption |
| **Magnesium, Iron, Zinc** | Fluoroquinolones, Tetracyclines | Same chelation mechanism as calcium |
| **Grapefruit / Grapefruit juice** | Statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin), Calcium channel blockers, Cyclosporine, some antiretrovirals | Puranocoumarins in grapefruit irreversibly inhibit intestinal CYP3A4 → massive increase in drug bioavailability → toxicity |
| **St John's Wort (Hypericum)** | Warfarin, OCP, HIV antiretrovirals, Cyclosporine, Digoxin | Potent CYP3A4 inducer → accelerated drug metabolism → treatment failure |
| **High-fat meal** | Fat-soluble drugs (e.g., Griseofulvin, Spironolactone, Isotretinoin) | Increases bioavailability → take with food as directed |
| **High-protein diet** | Levodopa (Parkinson's) | Large neutral amino acids compete with levodopa for intestinal and CNS transport → take 30 min before meals |
| **Caffeine** | Adenosine receptor drugs (e.g., Dipyridamole, Regadenoson, Adenosine) | Caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist; invalidates pharmacological cardiac stress tests |
| **Tyramine-rich foods (aged cheese, cured meat, fermented)** | MAO Inhibitors (MAOIs — e.g., Phenelzine) | MAOIs block tyramine breakdown → hypertensive crisis; strict dietary tyramine restriction essential |

## Supplementation Timing Guide

| Supplement | Best Time | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)** | With largest meal (containing fat) | Require bile/micelles for absorption |
| **Calcium carbonate** | With meals | Requires gastric acid for dissolution |
| **Calcium citrate** | Anytime (with or without food) | Does not require stomach acid |
| **Iron** | On empty stomach (or with Vitamin C) | Avoid taking with tea, coffee, calcium, dairy |
| **Magnesium (glycinate/malate)** | Evening | Promotes relaxation; better sleep quality |
| **Zinc** | Away from meals (if nausea-tolerant); else with small amount of food | Food reduces absorption but helps tolerance |
| **B vitamins complex** | Morning with food | B vitamins are energising; evening use may affect sleep |
| **Vitamin B12** | Morning | May increase alertness / energy |
| **Probiotics (capsule form)** | With or just before a meal (not on empty stomach) | Food buffers stomach acid, increasing probiotic survival |
| **Omega-3 fatty acids** | With meals containing fat | Reduces fishy reflux; fat enhances absorption |
| **Creatine monohydrate** | Post-workout with carbohydrates | Insulin enhances muscle creatine uptake |
| **Beta-alanine** | Pre-workout or split across day | Minimise paraesthesia by using smaller more frequent doses |
| **Caffeine** | 30–60 min pre-exercise | Ergogenic window; avoid within 6–8 h of sleep |
| **CoQ10** | With fat-containing meal | Fat-soluble; co-ingestion with fat improves absorption |
| **Vitamin C** | Split through the day (2–3 doses) | Saturable transport — 200 mg × 3 absorbed better than 1000 mg × 1 |
| **Curcumin** | With fat + black pepper | Dramatically improves bioavailability |
| **Resveratrol** | Separate from Metformin by 2+ h | Both activate SIRT1/AMPK — possible additive hypoglycaemia risk |

## Competitive Absorption Summary (Quick Reference)

```
At the intestinal transporter level, these nutrients compete:

DMT1 (divalent metal transporter):  Fe²⁺ ←→ Zn²⁺ ←→ Cu²⁺ ←→ Mn²⁺ ←→ Cd²⁺
                                     (all inhibit each other at high doses)

Shared Ca²⁺ channel / passive diffusion:  Ca²⁺ ←→ Mg²⁺ ←→ Zn²⁺

Folate transporter (PCFT/RFC):  Folate antagonists (methotrexate, trimethoprim) block folate entry
```

**Rule of thumb:** Divalent cations (Fe²⁺, Zn²⁺, Cu²⁺, Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺, Mn²⁺) all compete at shared transporters. Do not mega-dose one without considering impact on others.

## Anti-Nutrient Overview

Compounds in foods that reduce nutrient availability:

| Anti-Nutrient | Food Sources | Nutrients Blocked | Deactivation Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phytic acid (Phytate)** | Grains, legumes, nuts, seeds | Iron, Zinc, Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus | Soaking, sprouting, fermenting, cooking |
| **Oxalic acid (Oxalate)** | Spinach, beet greens, rhubarb, Swiss chard | Calcium, Iron, Magnesium | Boiling (discarding water); pairing with low-oxalate sources |
| **Tannins** | Tea, coffee, red wine, sorghum | Iron, Zinc, Protein | Consume separately from mineral-rich meals |
| **Lectins** | Raw legumes (especially kidney beans), nightshades | Protein digestion, gut lining integrity | Full cooking (minimum 10 min boiling for kidney beans); pressure cooking |
| **Goitrogens** | Raw cruciferous (broccoli, kale, Brussels), millet, cassava | Iodine absorption / thyroid hormone synthesis | Cooking significantly reduces goitrogenic activity |
| **Avidin** | Raw egg white | Biotin (B7) | Cooking destroys avidin; biotin binds irreversibly to raw avidin |
| **Solanine** | Green/sprouted potatoes | Cholinesterase inhibitor (not a nutrient antagonist, but toxic) | Avoid green potatoes; don't eat sprouts |
