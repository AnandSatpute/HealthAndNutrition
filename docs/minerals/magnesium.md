# Magnesium (Mg)

## Overview
Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and the second most abundant intracellular cation after potassium. It is a cofactor for over **300 enzymatic reactions**, including all reactions involving ATP (which must be complexed as Mg-ATP to be biologically active). Approximately 60% of body magnesium is in bone, 39% in soft tissues, and less than 1% in serum.

- **Atomic number:** 12; divalent cation (Mg²⁺)
- **Category:** Macromineral
- **Body content:** ~25 g in average adult
- **Key fact:** Serum magnesium accounts for <1% of total body magnesium — serum levels are a poor marker of total body status.

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 350 mg/day from **supplements only** (food magnesium has no established UL). The UL applies to non-food sources only due to osmotic laxative effect.

## Functions
- **ATP Activation:** Mg²⁺ chelates ATP to form the biologically active Mg-ATP complex required by all ATPases, kinases, and energy-transducing enzymes.
- **DNA Synthesis and Repair:** Cofactor for DNA polymerases, ligases, and repair enzymes; essential for RNA transcription.
- **Protein Synthesis:** Required by ribosomes for ternary complex formation during translation.
- **Glycolysis:** Cofactor for phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, and enolase.
- **Bone Mineralisation:** Incorporated into bone hydroxyapatite; stimulates osteoblast activity and regulates bone crystal size.
- **Calcium Channel Blockade:** Acts as a physiological antagonist of voltage-gated calcium channels — the basis for its anticonvulsant and antiarrhythmic effects.
- **Neuromuscular Transmission:** Regulates pre-synaptic calcium entry and inhibits acetylcholine release; magnesium deficiency causes neuromuscular hyperexcitability.
- **Cardiovascular:** Vasodilation; inhibits platelet aggregation; antiarrhythmic (prolonged refractory period).
- **Insulin Signalling:** Required for insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity; deficiency associated with insulin resistance.
- **PTH and Vitamin D Metabolism:** Required for PTH secretion and for hydroxylation steps in vitamin D activation.

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Vitamin B6** | Needed for magnesium transport into cells (PLP-dependent processes) |
| **Vitamin D** | Reciprocal: magnesium is required for vitamin D activation, and vitamin D may improve Mg absorption |
| **Potassium** | Hypomagnesaemia causes potassium wasting; both deficiencies often co-occur |
| **ATP** | Required target for Mg²⁺ complexation — linked in all enzymatic activity |

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | 30–40% of dietary intake absorbed; primarily paracellular in ileum and colon; TRPM6/TRPM7 channels for active transport |
| **Absorption increases** | Low dietary intake, vitamin D sufficiency, protein intake, fermentable fibre |
| **Absorption decreases** | High phytate, oxalate, high calcium intake, alcohol, chronic PPI use |
| **Distribution** | ~60% bone; ~39% muscles/soft tissue; <1% serum (0.75–0.95 mmol/L normal) |
| **Excretion** | Kidneys are principal regulators; ~120 mg/day filtered; reabsorbed primarily in thick ascending loop of Henle |
| **Renal conservation** | Deficiency triggers up to 95% tubular reabsorption (highly efficient) |
| **Half-life (serum)** | Not applicable — serum levels reflect renal handling, not true stores |

## Effects of Deficiency (Hypomagnesaemia)
Serum Mg <0.75 mmol/L. Often concurrent with hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia.

**Causes:**
- Excessive alcohol consumption (major cause)
- Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (urinary Mg wasting)
- Chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption syndromes
- Loop/thiazide diuretics
- Prolonged PPI use
- Post-surgery (refeeding, bowel resection)
- Medications: cisplatin, amphotericin B, aminoglycosides

**Symptoms:**
- **Early:** Anorexia, nausea, fatigue, weakness
- **Neuromuscular:** Tremor, muscle cramps, tetany (Trousseau's/Chvostek's sign)
- **Cardiac:** Prolonged PR/QT intervals, arrhythmias (PVCs, VT, VF) — especially dangerous
- **Neurological:** Confusion, depression, personality changes; seizures in severe deficiency
- **Bone:** Hypomagnesaemia → hypocalcaemia (impairs PTH secretion and action)
- **Electrolyte:** Refractory hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia that cannot be corrected until Mg is replete

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Mild deficiency (asymptomatic) | Oral magnesium glycinate/citrate/malate 200–400 mg/day (better tolerated than oxide) |
| Moderate deficiency | Oral 400–800 mg/day elemental Mg; correct underlying cause |
| Severe / symptomatic | IV magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄) 1–4 g over 15–60 minutes; repeat as needed |
| Eclampsia/pre-eclampsia | IV MgSO₄ 4–6 g loading dose then 1–2 g/hour maintenance (gold standard) |
| Torsades de pointes | IV MgSO₄ 2 g over 1–2 minutes (regardless of serum Mg level) |
| Severe asthma (acute) | IV MgSO₄ 2 g over 20 minutes (bronchodilator effect) |
| Migraine prophylaxis | Oral 400–600 mg/day — evidence-supported |

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Loop diuretics (furosemide) | Increase urinary Mg excretion → hypomagnesaemia |
| Thiazide diuretics | Increase urinary Mg wasting |
| Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) | Long-term use impairs intestinal Mg absorption → clinically significant hypomagnesaemia |
| Cisplatin | Nephrotoxic magnesium wasting (tubular damage) |
| Amphotericin B | Renal Mg wasting |
| Aminoglycosides | Tubular damage → Mg loss |
| Digoxin | Hypomagnesaemia increases digoxin toxicity risk |
| Bisphosphonates | Mg may reduce absorption; separate by ≥2 hours |
| Calcium channel blockers | Magnesium potentiates hypotensive effects |
| Magnesium antacids/laxatives + antibiotics (quinolones, tetracyclines) | Chelation reduces antibiotic absorption — separate by ≥2 hours |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Magnesium (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Pumpkin seeds (roasted) | 28g | ~150 mg |
| Chia seeds | 28g | ~111 mg |
| Almonds | 28g | ~80 mg |
| Cooked spinach | 90g | ~78 mg |
| Cashews | 28g | ~74 mg |
| Black beans (cooked) | 90g | ~60 mg |
| Edamame (cooked) | 90g | ~50 mg |
| Whole wheat bread | 2 slices | ~46 mg |
| Dark chocolate (70–85% cacao) | 28g | ~65 mg |
| Avocado | ½ medium | ~22 mg |
| Banana | 1 medium | ~32 mg |

---

## Storage & Stability
- As a mineral, magnesium is not degraded by cooking, light, or storage.
- Refining of grains removes magnesium-rich bran and germ — white flour provides <30% the Mg of whole wheat flour.
- Processing and boiling (and discarding cooking water) reduce Mg in vegetables.

## Toxicity (Hypermagnesaemia)

Almost exclusively occurs in renal failure or with excessive supplemental/therapeutic use.

| Serum Level | Clinical Effect |
|---|---|
| >1.1 mmol/L | Nausea, flushing, hypotension |
| >2.5 mmol/L | Loss of deep tendon reflexes, somnolence |
| >5 mmol/L | Respiratory paralysis, heart block |
| >7.5 mmol/L | Cardiac arrest |

**Treatment:** IV calcium gluconate (antagonises Mg²⁺ at calcium channels), hydration, and haemodialysis in renal failure.

> **Oral magnesium supplement toxicity:** Causes osmotic diarrhoea long before systemic toxicity — self-limiting in normal renal function.
