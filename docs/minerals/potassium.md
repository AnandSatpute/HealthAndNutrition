# Potassium (K)

## Overview
Potassium is the principal intracellular cation, with approximately **98% of total body potassium located inside cells** at a concentration of ~150 mmol/L — nearly 40 times the extracellular concentration. This gradient, maintained by the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase pump, is fundamental to membrane potential, nerve conduction, and muscle contractility.

- **Atomic number:** 19; monovalent cation (K⁺)
- **Category:** Macromineral / Electrolyte
- **Body content:** ~140 g in average adult (98% intracellular)
- **Normal serum range:** 3.5–5.0 mmol/L

## Requirements (AI)

| Age / Group | Adequate Intake (AI) |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 400 mg/day |
| Infants 7–12 months | 860 mg/day |
| Children 1–3 years | 2,000 mg/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 2,300 mg/day |
| Adolescents 14–18 (male) | 3,000 mg/day |
| Adolescents 14–18 (female) | 2,300 mg/day |
| Adult Men 19+ | 3,400 mg/day |
| Adult Women 19+ | 2,600 mg/day |
| Pregnant Women | 2,900 mg/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 2,800 mg/day |

> Most Western diets provide well below the AI — approximately 2,500 mg/day for men and 2,000 mg/day for women.

## Functions
- **Resting Membrane Potential:** K⁺ is the primary determinant of resting membrane potential (~−70 mV in neurons); the K⁺ outward diffusion gradient creates cell excitability.
- **Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase Pump:** Pumps 3 Na⁺ out and 2 K⁺ in per ATP cycle — maintains electrochemical gradients in every cell.
- **Cardiac Rhythm:** K⁺ channels govern phase 3 repolarisation of the cardiac action potential; serum K⁺ critically affects arrhythmia risk.
- **Muscle Contraction:** Required for skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle function.
- **Blood Pressure Regulation:** Potassium promotes vasodilation and natriuresis — higher K⁺ intake is consistently associated with lower blood pressure.
- **Renal Acid-Base Balance:** K⁺ and H⁺ exchange in renal tubules; hypokalaemia causes metabolic alkalosis.
- **Insulin Secretion:** KATP channel closure in pancreatic β cells triggers insulin release after glucose uptake.

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Magnesium** | Required for Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase; hypomagnesaemia causes refractory hypokalaemia |
| **Aldosterone** | Increases renal K⁺ excretion in exchange for Na⁺ reabsorption |
| **Insulin** | Drives K⁺ into cells acutely — used therapeutically in hyperkalaemia |
| **β₂-agonists** | Shift K⁺ intracellularly — used in acute hyperkalaemia management |

---

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | ~85–90% absorbed in small intestine via passive and active transport |
| **Distribution** | 98% intracellular (muscle ~75–80% of total body K⁺) |
| **Excretion** | ~90% renal (aldosterone-regulated in collecting duct); ~10% faecal |
| **Renal conservation** | Less efficient than Na⁺ — obligatory urinary loss of 5–20 mEq/day minimum |

---

## Effects of Deficiency (Hypokalaemia)
Serum K⁺ <3.5 mmol/L.

**Causes:** Loop/thiazide diuretics (most common), vomiting, diarrhoea, laxative abuse, mineralocorticoid excess, insulin overdose, β₂-agonist therapy, refeeding syndrome, amphotericin B, cisplatin.

**Symptoms:**
- **Cardiac:** Flat T waves, prominent U waves, PVCs, VT, VF — life-threatening
- **Musculoskeletal:** Weakness, muscle cramps, paralysis, rhabdomyolysis
- **GI:** Constipation, ileus
- **Renal:** Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, metabolic alkalosis
- **Neurological:** Paraesthesiae, restless legs

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Mild hypokalaemia (3.0–3.5) | Oral KCl 40–80 mEq/day; increase dietary K⁺ |
| Moderate (2.5–3.0) | Oral KCl 100–160 mEq/day; ECG monitoring |
| Severe / symptomatic (<2.5 or cardiac) | IV KCl via central line, max 20 mEq/hour; continuous ECG monitoring |
| Concurrent hypomagnesaemia | Correct Mg first — K⁺ replacement will fail without it |

> **Never give IV potassium as a bolus** — fatal cardiac arrest risk.

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Loop diuretics | Major cause of K⁺ wasting → hypokalaemia |
| Thiazide diuretics | Significant urinary K⁺ loss |
| ACE inhibitors / ARBs | Reduce aldosterone → increase serum K⁺ → hyperkalaemia risk |
| Potassium-sparing diuretics | Block K⁺ excretion → hyperkalaemia risk |
| Digoxin | Hypokalaemia dramatically increases toxicity risk |
| Insulin | Drives K⁺ into cells; diabetics on high-dose insulin at risk |
| NSAIDs | Can cause hyperkalaemia especially with ACEi/ARBs |
| Amphotericin B | Renal K⁺ and Mg wasting |

## Storage & Stability
- Potassium is a mineral — not degraded by cooking or storage.
- Food processing reduces potassium content; cooking and discarding water removes significant potassium from vegetables.

## Toxicity (Hyperkalaemia)
Serum K⁺ >5.0 mmol/L. Can be fatal.

**Causes:** Renal failure (most common), ACE inhibitors/ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics, IV K⁺ overdose, massive haemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, Addison's disease, acidosis.

**ECG progression:** Peaked T waves → wide PR → wide QRS → sine wave → VF/asystole.

**Treatment:**
1. **Membrane stabilisation:** IV calcium gluconate (immediate cardiac protection)
2. **Transcellular shift:** Insulin + glucose IV, nebulised salbutamol, sodium bicarbonate (if acidotic)
3. **K⁺ removal:** Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate or patiromer (oral binders), loop diuretics, haemodialysis
