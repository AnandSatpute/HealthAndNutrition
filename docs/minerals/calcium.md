# Calcium (Ca)

## Overview
Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human body, with approximately **99% stored in bones and teeth** as hydroxyapatite crystals, and the remaining 1% in blood, muscles, and extracellular fluid. This 1% is metabolically vital — calcium is a universal intracellular second messenger and is essential for muscle contraction, nerve signalling, enzyme activation, and blood coagulation.

- **Atomic number:** 20; divalent cation (Ca²⁺)
- **Category:** Macromineral (required in hundreds of mg/day)
- **Body content:** ~1,000–1,200 g in average adult
- **Bone reservoir:** Acts as a dynamic calcium buffer — constantly remodelled to maintain serum calcium within a tight range (2.1–2.6 mmol/L)

## Functions
- **Bone and Teeth Mineralisation:** Forms structural hydroxyapatite [Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)₂] in skeletal tissue; critical for peak bone mass development in adolescence.
- **Muscle Contraction:** Ca²⁺ binds troponin C in cardiac and skeletal muscle, initiating actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling. Required for smooth muscle tone.
- **Nerve Impulse Transmission:** Regulates neurotransmitter vesicle release at synaptic terminals via Ca²⁺-driven exocytosis.
- **Blood Clotting:** Multiple coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, X) require Ca²⁺ as a cofactor; essential in the clotting cascade.
- **Enzyme Activation:** Activates calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, phospholipases, and protease calpain.
- **Cell Signalling:** Acts as a second messenger in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and gene expression.
- **Hormone Secretion:** Stimulates insulin release from beta cells; regulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion inversely.
- **Vascular Function:** Involved in contraction and dilation of blood vessels.

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃)** | Upregulates intestinal TRPV6 calcium channel and calbindin-D9k; essential for active absorption |
| **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)** | Increases renal calcium reabsorption, stimulates bone resorption, activates vitamin D |
| **Vitamin K2 (MK-7)** | Activates osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein — directs calcium into bones and away from arteries |
| **Magnesium** | Required for PTH secretion and vitamin D activation; deficiency impairs calcium metabolism |
| **Phosphorus** | Forms Ca:P ratio in bone; ratio of 2:1 (Ca:P) is optimal |

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Active (duodenum/jejunum, vitamin D-dependent) and passive (throughout intestine); overall 25–35% of intake absorbed |
| **Factors increasing absorption** | Vitamin D sufficiency, acidic gastric pH, lactose, low calcium intake |
| **Factors decreasing absorption** | High oxalate (spinach), high phytate (bran), achlorhydria, excess phosphorus, high caffeine or sodium |
| **Distribution** | 99% bone/teeth; 0.9% intracellular; 0.1% extracellular fluid |
| **Regulation** | PTH, calcitonin, and 1,25-(OH)₂D₃ tightly maintain serum Ca²⁺ at 2.1–2.6 mmol/L |
| **Excretion** | Primarily renal (~200 mg/day); some faecal; renal reabsorption enhanced by PTH and vitamin D; increased by high sodium intake |

## Effects of Deficiency (Hypocalcaemia)
Acute hypocalcaemia is a medical emergency (serum Ca²⁺ <2.1 mmol/L corrected).

**Symptoms:**
- **Neuromuscular:** Tetany, muscle cramps, paraesthesiae (tingling in extremities and perioral area)
- **Neurological:** Seizures (hypocalcaemic), carpopedal spasm, Chvostek's sign (facial twitch), Trousseau's sign (carpal spasm with blood pressure cuff)
- **Cardiac:** Prolonged QT interval → arrhythmias; cardiac failure in severe cases
- **Skeletal (chronic):** Rickets (children), osteomalacia (adults), osteoporosis (long-term inadequacy)
- **Dental:** Enamel hypoplasia, impaired dental development

**At-Risk Populations:**
- Vitamin D-deficient individuals
- Post-menopausal women (oestrogen loss accelerates bone resorption)
- Elderly (reduced intestinal absorption, less sun exposure)
- Hypoparathyroidism and post-thyroidectomy patients
- Those with malabsorption (coeliac, Crohn's, short bowel syndrome)
- Vegans (especially if avoiding fortified foods)

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Acute severe hypocalcaemia | IV calcium gluconate (10 ml of 10% solution) over 10 minutes; ECG monitoring |
| Hypoparathyroidism | Oral calcium carbonate 1–3 g/day + calcitriol (active vitamin D) 0.25–1 µg/day |
| Dietary deficiency / osteoporosis prevention | 1,000–1,200 mg/day dietary + supplement if needed; co-administer vitamin D 800–2,000 IU/day |
| Rickets / Osteomalacia | High-dose vitamin D + calcium (regimen depends on cause) |
| Post-menopausal osteoporosis | Calcium + vitamin D + bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate) |

> Calcium carbonate is cheapest but requires stomach acid; calcium citrate is better absorbed in achlorhydria or with PPIs.

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate) | Calcium impairs absorption — separate by ≥2 hours |
| Fluoroquinolone / tetracycline antibiotics | Calcium chelates drug → reduced antibiotic absorption |
| Levothyroxine | Calcium reduces absorption — separate by ≥4 hours |
| Thiazide diuretics | Reduce urinary calcium excretion → may cause hypercalcaemia if calcium intake is high |
| Loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) | Increase urinary calcium loss |
| Corticosteroids | Impair intestinal calcium absorption; increase bone resorption |
| Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) | Reduce gastric acid → impair calcium carbonate absorption |
| Calcium channel blockers | High-dose calcium supplements may blunt their antihypertensive effect |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Calcium (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Parmesan cheese | 28g | ~336 mg |
| Milk (cow, whole) | 240 ml | ~300 mg |
| Plain yogurt (low-fat) | 245g | ~415 mg |
| Canned sardines (with bones) | 85g | ~325 mg |
| Fortified plant milk (soy, almond) | 240 ml | ~300 mg |
| Tofu (set with calcium sulfate) | 85g | ~250 mg |
| Kale (cooked) | 90g | ~95 mg |
| White beans (cooked) | 90g | ~80 mg |
| Bok choy (cooked) | 85g | ~79 mg |
| Broccoli (cooked) | 90g | ~60 mg |

> **Note:** Calcium from high-oxalate foods (spinach, beet greens, Swiss chard) has poor bioavailability (~5%) due to oxalate binding. Low-oxalate greens (kale, bok choy) offer much better absorption (~50%).

---

## Storage & Stability
- Calcium itself is a mineral element — it is not degraded by cooking, light, or storage.
- Bioavailability from food can be affected by cooking methods (e.g., boiling greens reduces oxalate content, improving Ca absorption).
- Calcium in supplements is stable indefinitely when stored dry.

## Toxicity (Hypercalcaemia)

| Cause | Details |
|---|---|
| Primary hyperparathyroidism | Most common cause; excess PTH increases bone resorption and renal Ca reabsorption |
| Excessive supplementation | UL of 2,000–2,500 mg/day may be exceeded by over-supplementation |
| Vitamin D toxicity | Excess 1,25-(OH)₂D₃ drives intestinal hyperabsorption |
| Granulomatous diseases | Sarcoidosis, TB produce excess active vitamin D |

**Symptoms of Hypercalcaemia:** "Bones, stones, groans, moans" — bone pain, nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), abdominal pain/constipation, fatigue/confusion. Severe cases: cardiac arrhythmia, renal failure, coma.

**Milk-Alkali Syndrome:** Excessive calcium carbonate intake (antacids) combined with milk → hypercalcaemia, metabolic alkalosis, and renal impairment.
