# Zinc (Zn)

## Overview
Zinc is the second most abundant trace mineral in the human body (after iron), with approximately 2–3 g in adults. It is present in every cell and is a structural or functional component of over **300 enzymes** and more than 1,000 transcription factors. Unlike iron, zinc has no direct redox activity (it stays as Zn²⁺) — it functions as a structural or Lewis acid (electron acceptor) catalyst in enzymes and as a stabiliser of protein-folding domains (zinc fingers).

- **Atomic number:** 30; always exists as Zn²⁺ (no redox cycling)
- **Category:** Trace mineral
- **Body content:** ~2–3 g, distributed in muscle (60%), bone (30%), skin, liver, prostate, and brain
- **Key fact:** No dedicated zinc storage pool exists — the body is highly sensitive to inadequate daily intake.

## Functions
- **Catalytic Role:** Zinc is a cofactor for ~300 enzymes across all six enzyme classes (oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases). Key examples:
  - **Carbonic anhydrase** — CO₂/HCO₃⁻ interconversion; critical for acid-base balance and CO₂ transport
  - **Alcohol dehydrogenase** — ethanol oxidation in liver
  - **Alkaline phosphatase** — bone mineralisation
  - **Carboxypeptidases** — protein digestion
  - **DNA/RNA polymerases** — replication and transcription
- **Structural Role (Zinc Fingers):** ~1,000 transcription factors contain zinc finger domains (Cys₂His₂, Cys₄ motifs) — regulate gene expression; critical for development, differentiation, and proliferation.
- **Wound Healing:** Zinc deficiency profoundly impairs wound healing — required for collagen synthesis, keratinocyte proliferation, and inflammatory cell function.
- **Immune Function:** Essential for thymulin (thymic hormone maturation), T-cell development, NK cell activity, and neutrophil function. Zinc is a master regulator of NF-κB signalling.
- **Antioxidant:** Structural component of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), which dismutates O₂⁻ radicals.
- **Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis:** Zinc signals regulate mTOR, p53 activation, and apoptotic pathways.
- **Taste and Smell:** Required for gustin (carbonic anhydrase VI) — mediates taste perception; deficiency causes ageusia/dysgeusia.
- **Reproduction:** Required for spermatogenesis, testosterone production, sperm motility, and oocyte maturation.
- **Vision:** Component of retinal dehydrogenase (retinol metabolism) and high concentration in the choroid and RPE of the eye.
- **Insulin Storage:** Zinc forms hexameric crystals of insulin in pancreatic beta cell granules, enabling dense storage.

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Protein intake** | Provides ligands (His, Cys, Glu, Asp) for zinc coordination in metalloenzymes |
| **Albumin (carrier)** | Transports ~60% of plasma zinc; hypoalbuminaemia can cause apparent hypozincaemia |
| **Metallothioneins** | Cysteine-rich intracellular proteins that buffer and store zinc; induced by excess zinc |
| **Vitamin A** | Zinc required for retinol-binding protein synthesis — deficiency of either impairs the other |

---

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | 20–40% dietary zinc absorbed; primarily in jejunum via ZIP4 transporter |
| **Enhancers** | Animal protein (partially overcomes phytate inhibition via digestion), citrate |
| **Inhibitors** | Phytate (major), high copper, high calcium, iron (competitive at very high doses), fibre |
| **Distribution** | Intracellular (90%); ~60% muscle, ~30% bone; minimal plasma fraction (~0.1%) |
| **Regulation** | Metallothionein induction and ZIP/ZnT transporter expression; no dedicated storage; body adapts via reduced excretion |
| **Excretion** | Primarily faecal (endogenous intestinal zinc); urinary excretion minor (~0.5 mg/day) |
| **Half-life (plasma)** | ~2–3 hours; pool turnover ~13 days |

## Effects of Deficiency
Zinc deficiency is common globally, particularly in populations relying on unfortified plant-based diets (high phytate). No single reliable biomarker — plasma zinc is used but is insensitive.

**Symptoms:**
- **Growth retardation** (most sensitive indicator in children)
- **Immune dysfunction:** Lymphopenia, reduced NK cell activity, increased susceptibility to infection (diarrhoea, pneumonia, malaria)
- **Hypogonadism and delayed sexual maturation** (males especially)
- **Dermatitis:** Perioral, perineal, and acral vesiculobullous rash (particularly in acrodermatitis enteropathica — hereditary Zn malabsorption)
- **Alopecia** (hair loss)
- **Ageusia/anosmia** — loss of taste and smell
- **Poor wound healing**
- **Diarrhoea** (in severe deficiency)
- **Night blindness** (secondary to vitamin A metabolism impairment)
- **Cognitive impairment and irritability**

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Mild-moderate deficiency | Zinc gluconate or zinc acetate 25–50 mg elemental Zn/day orally |
| Acrodermatitis enteropathica | Lifelong zinc supplementation 1–3 mg/kg/day |
| Diarrhoeal disease (children, WHO protocol) | Zinc sulfate 10–20 mg/day for 10–14 days — proven to reduce severity and duration |
| Childhood growth faltering | 5–10 mg/day supplemental zinc |
| Wound healing (chronic wounds) | 25–50 mg elemental Zn/day orally (if deficient) |
| Common cold (within 24 hrs onset) | Zinc acetate lozenges (75–80 mg/day) — reduces duration by ~1 day |

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Tetracyclines / fluoroquinolones | Zinc chelates drug → reduced antibiotic absorption — separate by ≥2 hours |
| Penicillamine | Drug chelates zinc → zinc depletion |
| Thiazide diuretics | Increase urinary zinc excretion |
| Copper supplements | High zinc blocks copper absorption (used therapeutically in Wilson's disease — 50 mg elemental Zn TID inhibits Cu uptake) |
| Iron supplements (>25 mg elemental) | Compete with zinc at DMT1 — separate if possible |
| Antacids / PPIs | Reduce gastric acid → impair zinc absorption marginally |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Zinc (mg) |

| Beef (chuck, cooked) | 85g | ~7.0 mg |
| Alaskan king crab | 85g | ~6.5 mg |
| Lobster | 85g | ~3.4 mg |
| Pork loin (cooked) | 85g | ~2.9 mg |

## Storage & Stability
- Zinc as a mineral is stable to cooking. Bioavailability from plant foods can be improved by soaking, fermenting, or sprouting legumes and grains (reduces phytate content).

## Toxicity

| Dose | Effect |
|---|---|
| >40 mg/day (UL) chronically | Impairs copper absorption → copper deficiency (sideroblastic anaemia, neuropathy) |
| >150 mg/day | Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, reduced HDL cholesterol |
| Acute toxicity | GI distress; metallic taste; reported from accidental exposure to high-dose supplements |
| Anti-denture cream case reports | Prolonged use of zinc-containing denture cream → severe copper deficiency neuropathy |
