# Manganese (Mn)

## Overview
Manganese is an essential trace mineral that functions as both a direct enzyme cofactor and as a structural component of metalloenzymes. Total body manganese is approximately 10–20 mg, concentrated in bone, liver, kidney, and brain. Its most critical role in humans is as a cofactor for **manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD, SOD2)** — the primary mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme.

- **Atomic number:** 25; exists primarily as Mn²⁺ and Mn³⁺ in biological systems
- **Category:** Trace mineral
- **Body content:** ~10–20 mg in average adult

## Requirements (AI)

| Age / Group | Adequate Intake (AI) |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 0.003 mg/day |
| Infants 7–12 months | 0.6 mg/day |
| Children 1–3 years | 1.2 mg/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 1.5 mg/day |
| Males 9–13 years | 1.9 mg/day |
| Females 9–13 years | 1.6 mg/day |
| Males 14–18 years | 2.2 mg/day |
| Females 14–18 years | 1.6 mg/day |
| Adult Men 19+ | 2.3 mg/day |
| Adult Women 19+ | 1.8 mg/day |
| Pregnant Women | 2.0 mg/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 2.6 mg/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 11 mg/day for adults from all sources.

## Functions
- **Mitochondrial Antioxidant (MnSOD / SOD2):** Manganese superoxide dismutase is the primary O₂⁻ scavenger in mitochondria; converts superoxide to H₂O₂ → further reduced by glutathione peroxidase or catalase.
- **Gluconeogenesis (Pyruvate Carboxylase):** Manganese activates pyruvate carboxylase (or is present in magnesium's place), catalysing pyruvate → oxaloacetate — the first step in gluconeogenesis.
- **Glycosaminoglycan Synthesis:** Manganese activates glycosyltransferases involved in chondroitin sulphate and heparan sulphate synthesis — essential for cartilage and extracellular matrix formation.
- **Urea Cycle (Arginase):** Mn-containing arginase converts arginine → urea + ornithine; essential for nitrogen disposal.
- **Glutamine Synthesis (Glutamine Synthetase):** Mn-dependent enzyme recycles glutamate + NH₃ → glutamine; important in the brain and liver.
- **Bone Formation:** Mn activates glycosyltransferases for osteocalcin and proteoglycan synthesis; low manganese → impaired bone formation.
- **Carbohydrate Metabolism:** Activates various kinases and phosphatases in carbohydrate pathways.
- **Coagulation:** Mn activates some clotting factors and cofactor for prothrombin synthesis.

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Iron** | Iron and manganese share intestinal absorptive transporters (DMT1); excess iron reduces Mn absorption |
| **Calcium** | High calcium reduces manganese absorption |
| **Magnesium** | Mg can substitute Mn in some enzyme-binding sites |

---

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | 1–5% of dietary intake; absorbed in small intestine via DMT1 (shared with iron); transferrin can bind Mn |
| **Absorption inversely related** | Higher body iron stores → lower manganese absorption |
| **Distribution** | Bone (~40%), liver, kidney, pancreas, brain; transported by transferrin and α₂-macroglobulin |
| **Homeostasis** | Primarily controlled by biliary excretion (not renal); bile secretion is the main regulatory mechanism |
| **Half-life** | ~37–39 days |

## Effects of Deficiency
True dietary manganese deficiency in humans is extremely rare and has not been documented naturally outside of experimental settings.

**Experimentally induced deficiency (Doisy 1972):** dermatitis, hypocholesterolaemia, impaired glucose tolerance, reduced coagulation factor activity, impaired growth.

**Marginal deficiency associations:** Reduced bone density, impaired glycosaminoglycan synthesis (cartilage), altered glucose metabolism, impaired reproductive function.

## Treatment Protocols
Manganese deficiency resolves with adequate dietary intake or supplementation at the AI level. No established therapeutic protocol for acquired deficiency due to its rarity.

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Parenteral nutrition without Mn | Include 55–100 µg/day Mn in TPN formulations |
| TPN-associated deficiency | Supplement 0.2–0.3 mg/day IV |

---

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Iron supplements | High iron reduces Mn absorption (shared DMT1 transporter) |
| Calcium / magnesium supplements | High intake can reduce Mn absorption |
| Antacids | May impair Mn absorption in the gut |
| Antipsychotics | Manganese may modulate dopamine neurotransmission |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Manganese (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Mussels (cooked) | 85g | ~5.8 mg |
| Hazelnuts | 28g | ~1.7 mg |
| Pecans | 28g | ~1.1 mg |
| Brown rice (cooked) | 195g | ~1.8 mg |
| Pineapple (chunks) | 165g | ~1.5 mg |
| Oatmeal (cooked) | 234g | ~1.4 mg |
| Tempeh | 85g | ~1.0 mg |
| Soybeans (roasted) | 85g | ~1.7 mg |
| Spinach (cooked) | 90g | ~0.8 mg |
| Tea (black, brewed) | 240 ml | ~0.5 mg |

## Storage & Stability
- Manganese in food is stable to heat and storage. Refining removes significant manganese — whole grains contain much more than refined flours.

## Toxicity (Manganism)
Dietary toxicity from food alone is essentially unknown. Toxicity is largely from **occupational/environmental inhalation** (mining, welding, battery manufacturing).

| Source | Effect |
|---|---|
| Inhalation (occupational) | **Manganism** — Parkinson-like syndrome (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, psychiatric symptoms); manganese preferentially accumulates in basal ganglia |
| Chronic TPN with excess Mn | Brain manganese accumulation → neurological symptoms (T1-bright basal ganglia on MRI) |
| Well water contamination | Elevated Mn in drinking water linked to cognitive deficits in children |
| Dietary excess (supplements) | UL 11 mg/day — chronic >11 mg/day associated with neurotoxic risk |

> Mn neurotoxicity is distinct from Parkinson's disease — involves globus pallidus and has specific clinical features.
