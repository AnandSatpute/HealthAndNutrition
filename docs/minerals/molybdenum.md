# Molybdenum (Mo)

## Overview
Molybdenum is an essential trace mineral that forms part of the **molybdenum cofactor (Moco)** — a complex with molybdopterin that is required by four human enzymes (molybdoenzymes). These enzymes catalyse oxidation-reduction reactions involved in the metabolism of purines, sulfur-containing amino acids, and certain heterocyclic compounds. Molybdenum deficiency is extraordinarily rare in the general population.

- **Atomic number:** 42; functions as Mo⁴⁺/Mo⁵⁺/Mo⁶⁺ in redox cycling within Moco
- **Category:** Trace mineral
- **Body content:** ~9 mg in average adult; distributed in liver, kidney, adrenal glands, bone
- **Key fact:** Molybdenum has the highest UL relative to dietary intake of any essential mineral — typical dietary intake is well within safe limits.

| Infants 0–6 months | 2 µg/day (AI) |
| Infants 7–12 months | 3 µg/day (AI) |

| Breastfeeding Women | 50 µg/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 2,000 µg/day (2 mg/day) for adults.

## Functions

Molybdenum functions via **four molybdoenzymes** in humans:

| Enzyme | Reaction | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **Xanthine oxidase / XDH** | Hypoxanthine → xanthine → uric acid (purine catabolism) | Uric acid is an important plasma antioxidant; excess causes gout |
| **Aldehyde oxidase** | Oxidises aromatic aldehydes (e.g., retinaldehyde → retinoic acid), pyrimidines, purine metabolites, drugs | Drug metabolism (phase I) in liver |
| **Sulfite oxidase** | Sulfite (SO₃²⁻) → sulfate (SO₄²⁻) — final step in cysteine and methionine catabolism | Detoxifies sulfite from protein catabolism and food preservation |
| **Mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC)** | Reduces N-hydroxylated bases and amidoximes; reduces nitrite to NO | Prodrug activation; nitric oxide metabolism |

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Molybdopterin (MPT)** | Organic scaffold complexed with Mo to form Moco; synthesised from GTP in a multi-step pathway |
| **FAD (riboflavin)** | Electron carrier in xanthine oxidase reaction |
| **Iron (Fe-S clusters)** | Xanthine oxidase contains both Moco and Fe-S clusters for electron transfer |
| **Copper** | At very high intakes, molybdenum forms thiomolybdate → binds copper → can cause copper deficiency (interaction in ruminants; clinically relevant in Wilson's disease treatment research) |

---

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | 88–93% of dietary molybdenum absorbed, primarily in upper GI tract |
| **Transport** | Circulates as molybdate (MoO₄²⁻) in plasma; loosely bound to red blood cells and albumin |
| **Distribution** | Liver and kidney (highest concentrations); bone |
| **Excretion** | Primarily urinary molybdate; kidneys are the primary homeostatic regulators |
| **Half-life** | ~50–96 hours (short; rapid renal handling) |

## Effects of Deficiency
Naturally occurring molybdenum deficiency has been documented in only one known case — a patient on long-term total parenteral nutrition without molybdenum supplementation.

**That case (1981):** Tachycardia, tachypnoea, night blindness, irritability → progressed to coma; elevated plasma methionine and low sulfate; resolved with IV ammonium molybdate supplementation.

**Confirmed genetic disorder — Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency (MoCD):** Autosomal recessive, loss of Moco biosynthesis enzymes → combined deficiency of all four molybdoenzymes. Presents in neonates with intractable seizures, severe intellectual disability, and elevated urinary sulfite. Formerly uniformly fatal; now treated with cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) substitution therapy for Type A (MOCODA gene).

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| TPN-induced deficiency | IV ammonium molybdate 163 µg/day |
| Standard TPN supplementation | 5–20 µg/day (for adults on TPN per ASPEN guidelines) |
| Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (Type A) | cPMP (fosdenopterin) substitution — IV daily; approved by FDA 2021 |
| Excess molybdenum (copper-Mo antagonism) | Reduce molybdenum intake; copper supplementation |

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Allopurinol | Inhibits xanthine oxidase (same enzyme molybdenum supports) — used for gout; reduces uric acid |
| Febuxostat | Also inhibits xanthine oxidase; additive with Mo restriction considerations |
| Copper supplements | Very high molybdenum → forms thiomolybdate → chelates copper → copper deficiency (theoretical in humans; demonstrated in ruminants) |
| Ammonium molybdate (therapeutic) | Used as molybdenum source in TPN |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Molybdenum (µg) |
|---|---|---|
| Legumes (black-eyed peas, cooked) | 90g | ~288 µg |
| Lima beans (boiled) | 90g | ~104 µg |
| Chickpeas (cooked) | 90g | ~66 µg |
| Oats (rolled, dry) | 40g | ~22 µg |
| Beef liver (cooked) | 85g | ~138 µg |
| Whole wheat bread | 2 slices | ~32 µg |
| Milk | 240 ml | ~8 µg |
| Eggs | 1 large | ~14 µg |
| Pork (cooked) | 85g | ~15 µg |

> **Note:** Molybdenum content of plant foods varies significantly with soil molybdenum levels; legumes are universally the richest sources.

## Storage & Stability
- Molybdenum in food is stable to cooking and storage.
- High-Mo foods (legumes) retain their molybdenum content well even after prolonged boiling.

---

## Toxicity
Molybdenum has very low toxicity in humans; the UL (2,000 µg/day) is more than 40× typical dietary intake (45–80 µg/day).

| Intake / Scenario | Effect |
|---|---|
| High endemic intake (Armenian highlands, Iraq — 10–15 mg/day from plant foods) | Gout-like symptoms (elevated uric acid from excess XO activity), diarrhoea, growth depression |
| Industrial exposure | Occupational exposure to molybdenum dust → respiratory effects; not typically from dietary intake |
| Animal studies (high doses) | Copper deficiency via thiomolybdate formation; anaemia, weight loss |

> **Gout connection:** Molybdenum excess → overactive xanthine oxidase → excess uric acid → gout. This is the most clinically relevant adverse effect. Conversely, xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol, febuxostat) are first-line gout treatments.
