# Chromium (Cr)

## Overview
Chromium is an essential trace mineral that potentiates the action of **insulin** and plays a role in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. It exists in biological systems as trivalent chromium (Cr³⁺) — the only biologically relevant and nutritionally important form. The function of chromium in insulin action has been attributed to a low-molecular-weight chromium-binding oligopeptide (LMWCr or **chromodulin**).

- **Atomic number:** 24; biologically active as Cr³⁺ (trivalent); Cr⁶⁺ (hexavalent) is industrial/toxic
- **Category:** Trace mineral
- **Body content:** ~4–6 mg in average adult; widely distributed, highest in liver, kidney, muscle, spleen
- **Key fact:** Chromium requirements are among the smallest of all essential minerals; deficiency in healthy free-living adults is rare.

## Requirements (AI)

| Age / Group | Adequate Intake (AI) |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 0.2 µg/day |
| Infants 7–12 months | 5.5 µg/day |
| Children 1–3 years | 11 µg/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 15 µg/day |
| Males 9–13 years | 25 µg/day |
| Females 9–13 years | 21 µg/day |
| Males 14–50 years | 35 µg/day |
| Females 14–18 years | 24 µg/day |
| Adult Women 19–50 | 25 µg/day |
| Adult Men 51+ | 30 µg/day |
| Adult Women 51+ | 20 µg/day |
| Pregnant Women | 29–30 µg/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 44–45 µg/day |

> No Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) has been established for trivalent chromium from food or supplements due to low toxicity and poor absorption. Cr⁶⁺ (hexavalent) has a separate UL of 0.1 mg/day from water.

## Functions
- **Insulin Sensitisation (Chromodulin):** Chromium is incorporated into chromodulin (LMWCr) — an oligopeptide consisting of glycine, cysteine, aspartate, and glutamate that binds 4 Cr³⁺ ions. Upon insulin receptor activation, chromodulin is released from stores and amplifies insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity.
- **Glucose Uptake:** By potentiating insulin signalling, chromium facilitates GLUT4 translocation to cell membranes → enhanced cellular glucose uptake.
- **Lipid Metabolism:** Chromium supplementation has been associated with modest improvements in triglyceride and HDL profiles in some studies, attributed to improved insulin sensitivity.
- **Protein Metabolism:** Chromium was used in livestock for muscle protein accretion — evidence in humans is weak.
- **Chromium and Exercise:** Claims about chromium picolinate for muscle building are largely not supported by robust human trials.

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Insulin receptor** | Chromium amplifies insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity — functional only when insulin pathway is intact |
| **Transferrin** | Primary chromium transport protein in plasma (alongside albumin) |
| **Nicotinic acid (B3)** | Early hypothesis that chromium formed a "glucose tolerance factor" (GTF) complex with niacin and amino acids — subsequently disproved; separate processes |

---

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Very low: 0.5–2% of dietary Cr³⁺; organic chromium (picolinate, nicotinate) slightly higher ~2–5% |
| **Absorbed as** | Cr³⁺ transported via transferrin in blood |
| **Distribution** | Liver, kidney, muscle, bone, spleen |
| **Excretion** | Primarily urinary; renal excretion increases with high carbohydrate intake and strenuous exercise |
| **Half-life** | Varies by tissue — short (~1 day) in plasma, longer in tissues |

## Effects of Deficiency
The evidence base for chromium essentiality is less robust than for other trace minerals.

**Clinical deficiency (documented only in patients on total parenteral nutrition without chromium):**
- Impaired glucose tolerance resembling type 2 diabetes
- Elevated fasting glucose and insulin
- Impaired lipid metabolism
- Peripheral neuropathy

**In free-living populations:** Chromium deficiency based on dietary intake is not well-documented; it is difficult to measure chromium status accurately (contamination confounds blood/urine measurements).

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Proven TPN-associated deficiency | IV chromium 10–15 µg/day in TPN formulation |
| Standard TPN maintenance | 10–15 µg/day IV (optimal long-term may be lower — reassessed given potential nephrotoxicity risk) |
| Type 2 diabetes / insulin resistance (controversial) | Chromium picolinate 200–1,000 µg/day studied; modest, inconsistent evidence; not a standard of care |

---

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen) | May increase chromium absorption (mechanism unclear) |
| Antacids | Alkaline pH reduces Cr³⁺ absorption |
| Iron supplements | Compete with chromium for transferrin binding; high iron may reduce chromium transport |
| Insulin / hypoglycaemic agents | Theoretical potentiation — monitor blood glucose if combining chromium supplements with insulin therapy |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Chromium (µg) |
|---|---|---|
| Broccoli (cooked) | 90g | ~22 µg |
| Grape juice | 240 ml | ~8 µg |
| English muffin (whole wheat) | 1 muffin | ~4 µg |
| Potatoes (mashed) | 1 cup | ~3 µg |
| Garlic (dried) | 1 tsp | ~3 µg |
| Turkey breast | 85g | ~2 µg |
| Beef (ground) | 85g | ~2 µg |
| Orange juice | 240 ml | ~2 µg |
| Apple (with peel) | 1 medium | ~1.4 µg |
| Green beans | 90g | ~1.1 µg |

> **Note:** Chromium content of foods is poorly characterised — values in databases have high variability due to soil and analytical contamination issues.

## Storage & Stability
- Chromium mineral content is stable to cooking and storage.
- Stainless steel cookware (which contains chromium) can leach small amounts of Cr³⁺ into acidic foods — generally considered safe and may contribute to intake.

---

## Toxicity
**Trivalent Cr³⁺ (dietary/supplemental forms):**
- Very low toxicity; no UL established from food sources
- Chromium picolinate at high doses (>1,000 µg/day) has theoretical concerns — picolinic acid may enhance cellular uptake beyond regulation; very rare reports of renal failure and rhabdomyolysis

**Hexavalent Cr⁶⁺ (industrial form — NOT dietary):**
- Potent carcinogen and mutagen; classified as IARC Group 1 (lung carcinogen via inhalation)
- Causes DNA strand breaks and oxidative damage
- Found in industrial settings (chrome plating, tanning, welding on stainless steel) and contaminated groundwater
