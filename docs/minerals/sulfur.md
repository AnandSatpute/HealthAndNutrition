# Sulfur (S)

## Overview
Sulfur is the third most abundant mineral in the body by mass. Unlike other minerals, sulfur does not exist as a free ion in biological systems — it functions almost entirely within **organic molecules**: the amino acids methionine (Met) and cysteine (Cys) are its primary biological vehicles, along with several vitamins (B1, B7, B5) and metabolites (glutathione, taurine, coenzyme A). Sulfur is essential for protein structure, detoxification, and redox chemistry.

- **Atomic number:** 16; biologically active primarily as organosulfur (thiols –SH, disulfides S–S, sulfate –SO₄²⁻)
- **Category:** Macromineral
- **Body content:** ~140 g in average adult
- **No dietary requirement established:** Sulfur is obtained via sulfur-containing amino acids (methionine, cysteine); no separate RDA or AI exists for elemental sulfur intake.

## Requirements
No Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for sulfur as an element. Requirements are met by adequate intake of **sulfur-containing amino acids:**
- **Methionine:** Essential amino acid (cannot be synthesised) — must be consumed in diet
- **Cysteine:** Conditionally essential — synthesised from methionine via the transsulfuration pathway

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Combined methionine + cysteine requirement | ~15 mg/kg/day (adult) |
| From protein perspective | Met + Cys should total ~1.7 g/day for 70 kg adult |

Additional sulfur also comes from vitamins B1 (thiamine), B5 (pantothenic acid), and B7 (biotin), as well as taurine and various food-derived organosulfur compounds.

## Functions
- **Protein Tertiary Structure:** Cysteine –SH groups form disulfide bonds (–S–S–) in extracellular proteins, antibodies (immunoglobulins), insulin, keratin, albumin, and enzymes — critical for 3D structure and stability.
- **Glutathione Synthesis:** γ-Glu-Cys-Gly (glutathione, GSH) is the major intracellular antioxidant. Cysteine provides the reactive –SH group required for free radical scavenging and detoxification.
- **Coenzyme A (CoA):** Pantothenic acid + cysteine-derived phosphopantetheine forms CoA — the universal acyl carrier in fatty acid metabolism, acetyl-CoA, and the citric acid cycle.
- **Iron-Sulfur Clusters:** Fe-S cluster proteins (in ETC Complexes I, II, III and many other enzymes) use cysteine-ligated iron and sulfur for electron transfer.
- **Phase II Detoxification (Sulfation):** Sulfate (from cysteine/methionine catabolism) conjugates to drugs, hormones (oestrogens, DHEA), and xenobiotics via SULT enzymes → increases water-solubility for renal excretion.
- **Taurine:** Cysteine-derived; used for bile acid conjugation (taurocholate), osmoregulation, retinal function, neurological development, and cardiac contractility.
- **Collagen and Keratin:** Cysteine is the most abundant amino acid in keratin (hair, nails, skin); disulfide bonds give keratin its rigidity.
- **B Vitamins:** Thiamine (B1) contains a thiazole ring with sulfur — essential for its function; biotin (B7) and pantothenic acid (B5) also contain sulfur in their active structures.
- **Methionine Cycle:** Methionine donates its methyl group as S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) — the universal methylation cosubstrate for DNA methylation, histone modification, neurotransmitter synthesis, and more.

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Vitamin B6 (PLP)** | Required for cystathionine synthase and cystathionine lyase in the transsulfuration pathway (Met → Cys) |
| **Vitamin B12** | Required for methionine synthase — regenerates methionine from homocysteine |
| **Folate** | Provides 5-methyl-THF to regenerate methionine; integrated with sulfur metabolism |
| **Zinc** | Zinc-finger proteins use Cys thiol groups for metal coordination |
| **Iron** | Fe-S clusters require both iron and cysteine-derived sulfide |

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Intake form** | Dietary proteins (methionine, cysteine); sulfur-containing vitamins; alliums (garlic, onion organosulfurs) |
| **Absorption** | Methionine and cysteine absorbed in small intestine as free amino acids or dipeptides via active transporters |
| **Metabolism** | Methionine → (SAM → SAH → homocysteine) → cysteine (transsulfuration) → taurine, sulfate, or glutathione |
| **Excretion** | As inorganic sulfate in urine (main route); taurine in urine; glutathione metabolites in urine and bile |
| **Sulfur balance** | Closely tied to protein (nitrogen) balance; high-protein diets generate significant acid load via sulfate excretion |

## Effects of Deficiency
True isolated sulfur (as element) deficiency does not occur in practice — deficiency manifests as **methionine or cysteine deficiency**, typically as part of broader protein-energy malnutrition.

**Key manifestations in protein-sulfur deficiency:**
- **Kwashiorkor:** Oedema, muscle wasting, fatty liver, impaired immune function — glutathione depletion plays a role
- **Glutathione depletion:** Increased oxidative stress, impaired detoxification, susceptibility to infection and drug toxicity
- **Impaired collagen crosslinking:** Poor wound healing, weakened connective tissue
- **Taurine deficiency:** Rare, but can affect retinal function, cardiac contractility, and bile acid conjugation; seen in long-term exclusively vegan parenteral nutrition without taurine supplementation
- **Hair and nail fragility:** Keratin synthesis impaired in severe protein deficiency

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Protein-energy malnutrition | Gradual refeeding with protein-complete diet; include animal or complementary plant proteins |
| Acetaminophen/paracetamol overdose | N-acetylcysteine (NAC) — replenishes glutathione depleted by toxic NAPQI metabolite; 150 mg/kg IV loading dose |
| Glutathione depletion (oxidative stress) | NAC 600–1,200 mg/day oral; cysteine/whey protein supplementation |
| Homocystinuria (CBS deficiency) | High-dose B6 if responsive; methionine-restricted diet; betaine supplementation |
| Mucous plugging in cystic fibrosis | Inhaled N-acetylcysteine (mucolytic — breaks disulfide bonds in mucus) |

---

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| N-acetylcysteine (NAC) | Reduces efficacy of nitrates (tolerance mechanism); mucolytic/antidote use |
| High-protein diet + sulfur amino acids | Acid load (sulfate) can increase calcium urinary excretion → potential bone effects |
| Warfarin + garlic/organosulfur supplements | High-dose garlic may enhance anticoagulant effect |
| Cisplatin | Competes with Cys-thiol groups; NAC may reduce nephrotoxicity but could reduce efficacy |
| Disulfiram (Antabuse) | Contains Cys-reactive organosulfur that inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase |
| Penicillamine | Contains sulfur; chelates copper and other metals; depletes vitamin B6 |

## Food Sources

Sulfur is obtained from protein foods (methionine/cysteine) and allium/cruciferous vegetables (organosulfur compounds):

| Food | Key Sulfur Compounds |
|---|---|
| Eggs (especially whites and yolks) | High methionine, high cysteine |
| Meat and poultry | High methionine and cysteine |
| Fish and seafood | High methionine; taurine-rich |
| Dairy (whey protein) | Cysteine-rich (excellent glutathione precursor) |
| Garlic and onions | Allicin, alliin, diallyl disulfide |
| Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale | Glucosinolates (sulforaphane precursors — potent phase II enzyme inducers) |
| Legumes | Moderate methionine; complementary with grains (which are cysteine-rich) |
| Whole grains | Cysteine-containing proteins |

---

## Storage & Stability
- Sulfur-containing amino acids in foods are generally heat-stable.
- Allicin (from garlic) is generated enzymatically when plant tissue is crushed — degraded by cooking; raw garlic provides most organosulfur benefits.
- Glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables are converted to sulforaphane by myrosinase (enzyme in the plant) when chewed or crushed; light steaming is preferable to boiling for preserving activity.

## Toxicity
Elemental sulfur and dietary organic sulfur from food have very low toxicity in humans with normal kidney function.

| Form | Toxicity Details |
|---|---|
| Dietary sulfur amino acids | No UL established; high methionine may theoretically raise homocysteine if B12/folate are deficient |
| Inorganic sulfate | Osmotic diarrhoea at high doses (sulfate salts used as laxatives); tolerated in normal renal function |
| Organosulfur supplements (garlic, MSM) | Generally safe; MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) up to 3 g/day well-tolerated |
| Sulfur dioxide (SO₂ food preservative) | Can trigger asthma in sensitive individuals; regulated in food labelling |
| H₂S (hydrogen sulfide) | Toxic gas — not a dietary concern; relevant in industrial/environmental exposure |
