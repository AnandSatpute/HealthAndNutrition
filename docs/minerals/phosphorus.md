# Phosphorus (P)

## Overview
Phosphorus is the second most abundant mineral in the body, with approximately **85% stored in bones and teeth** as hydroxyapatite. The remaining 15% is distributed throughout every cell and in extracellular fluid, where it plays central roles in energy metabolism, nucleic acid synthesis, and membrane structure. Phosphorus exists in the body primarily as **phosphate (PO₄³⁻)** in various ionisation states.

- **Atomic number:** 15; forms phosphate anion (H₂PO₄⁻, HPO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻) at physiological pH
- **Category:** Macromineral
- **Body content:** ~700–800 g in average adult
- **Key fact:** Phosphorus exists almost entirely as organic or inorganic phosphate — elemental phosphorus is not found in biological systems.

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 4,000 mg/day for adults 19–70; 3,000 mg/day for adults 70+.

## Functions
- **Bone and Teeth Mineralisation:** Forms structural hydroxyapatite with calcium; phosphorus:calcium weight ratio in bone ≈ 1:2.
- **Energy Metabolism (ATP):** Core component of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) — the universal cellular energy currency. Also in ADP, AMP, GTP, and creatine phosphate.
- **Nucleic Acid Backbone:** Phosphate groups form the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA and RNA.
- **Phospholipid Membranes:** Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and other phospholipids form all biological membranes.
- **Enzyme Regulation:** Protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is the most ubiquitous cellular signalling mechanism; kinases and phosphatases control virtually all cellular processes.
- **Acid-Base Buffer:** Inorganic phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻) is a major intracellular and urinary buffer (pKa ≈ 6.8).
- **Oxygen Delivery:** 2,3-BPG (bisphosphoglycerate) in red blood cells regulates haemoglobin's oxygen affinity.
- **B Vitamins Activation:** Forms the phosphorylated active coenzyme forms of B1 (TPP), B2 (FMN, FAD), B3 (NAD, NADP), B6 (PLP).

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Vitamin D** | Promotes intestinal phosphate absorption via NaPi-IIb transporter; increases renal reabsorption |
| **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)** | Decreases renal tubular phosphate reabsorption (phosphaturic effect) |
| **FGF-23 (Fibroblast Growth Factor-23)** | Bone-derived hormone that increases phosphate excretion; important in CKD |
| **Calcium** | Maintains proper Ca:P ratio; excess phosphorus impairs calcium metabolism |

---

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Primarily in jejunum; 55–70% of dietary phosphorus absorbed; inorganic phosphate (from additives) absorbed at ~90% |
| **Bioavailability** | Reduced by phytate in plant foods (bound form absorbed poorly without phytase); high bioavailability from animal sources |
| **Distribution** | 85% bone/teeth; 14% soft tissue (mainly intracellular); <1% extracellular fluid |
| **Normal serum range** | 0.8–1.45 mmol/L (2.5–4.5 mg/dL) |
| **Regulation** | PTH, vitamin D, FGF-23, and calcitonin regulate serum phosphate |
| **Excretion** | Primarily renal; renal tubular reabsorption modulated by PTH and FGF-23 |

## Effects of Deficiency (Hypophosphataemia)
Serum phosphate <0.8 mmol/L. True dietary deficiency is rare given phosphorus abundance in food; occurs mainly in clinical settings.

**Causes:**
- Refeeding syndrome (high insulin drives phosphate intracellularly)
- Antacid overuse (aluminium/magnesium hydroxide binds dietary phosphate)
- Hyperparathyroidism
- Malabsorption syndromes
- Severe alcoholism
- Diabetic ketoacidosis treatment

**Symptoms:**
- **Musculoskeletal:** Proximal muscle weakness, bone pain, fractures; rickets (children), osteomalacia (adults)
- **Haematological:** Haemolytic anaemia (low 2,3-BPG impairs RBC membrane), impaired platelet function
- **Neurological:** Confusion, irritability, paraesthesiae, seizures, coma in severe cases
- **Respiratory:** Diaphragmatic weakness → ventilatory failure (life-threatening in ICU patients)
- **Cardiac:** Reduced cardiac output, cardiomyopathy in severe cases

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Mild-moderate hypophosphataemia | Oral phosphate supplementation (e.g., sodium/potassium phosphate salts) 1–2 g/day |
| Severe / symptomatic hypophosphataemia | IV sodium phosphate or potassium phosphate; rate ≤7.5 mmol/hour under ECG monitoring |
| Refeeding syndrome prevention | Gradual caloric reintroduction; monitor and supplement electrolytes before re-feeding |
| X-linked hypophosphataemic rickets | Oral phosphate + calcitriol; or burosumab (anti-FGF-23 monoclonal antibody) |

---

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Aluminium/magnesium antacids | Bind dietary phosphate → hypophosphataemia with chronic use |
| Calcium supplements (high dose) | Form calcium-phosphate complexes → reduced phosphate absorption |
| Sevelamer / lanthanum carbonate | Phosphate binders used in chronic kidney disease (intended effect) |
| Calcimimetics (cinacalcet) | Reduce PTH → increase renal phosphate reabsorption |
| Furosemide | Promotes renal phosphate excretion |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Phosphorus (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Baked salmon | 85g | ~315 mg |
| Chicken breast (cooked) | 85g | ~220 mg |
| Low-fat milk | 240 ml | ~240 mg |
| Lentils (cooked) | 180g | ~360 mg |
| Whole wheat bread | 2 slices | ~136 mg |
| Sunflower seeds | 28g | ~330 mg |
| Almonds | 28g | ~136 mg |
| Plain yogurt | 245g | ~385 mg |
| Canned tuna | 85g | ~230 mg |

> **Important:** Phosphoric acid used as an additive in carbonated soft drinks (especially cola beverages) provides highly bioavailable phosphate (~250 mg/350 ml can) and, with high intake, may adversely affect the Ca:P ratio and bone health.

## Storage & Stability
- Phosphorus as a mineral is element-level stable — not degraded by cooking or storage.
- Phytate-bound phosphorus in plant foods can be released by soaking, fermenting, or sprouting (activates endogenous phytase).

## Toxicity (Hyperphosphataemia)

Serum phosphate >1.45 mmol/L. Most common in **chronic kidney disease (CKD)** when renal phosphate excretion is impaired.

| Effect | Details |
|---|---|
| Secondary hyperparathyroidism | Excess phosphate suppresses calcitriol, raises PTH → bone resorption |
| Vascular calcification | Calcium-phosphate deposits in vessel walls → cardiovascular disease |
| Hypocalcaemia | Phosphate binds serum calcium → tetany risk |
| Soft tissue calcification | Deposition in joints, skin (calcinosis cutis), organs |

In individuals with normal kidney function, dietary excess is efficiently excreted and toxicity from food alone is rare. UL is set at 4,000 mg/day.
