# Fluoride (F)

## Overview
Fluoride (the ionised form of fluorine) is a trace mineral that is unique in that its primary biological function is **prevention of dental caries** rather than acting as an enzyme cofactor. It is incorporated into the crystalline structure of tooth enamel and bone, enhancing resistance to acid dissolution. Fluoride is found naturally in water, soil, and some foods; it is also widely added to drinking water and toothpaste as a public health intervention.

- **Atomic number:** 9 (fluorine); exists in biological systems as fluoride ion (F⁻)
- **Category:** Trace mineral
- **Body content:** ~2.6 g in average adult; primary storage in bone and teeth (as fluorapatite)
- **Key fact:** Water fluoridation is one of the ten greatest public health achievements of the 20th century (CDC); optimal concentration is 0.7 mg/L.

## Requirements (AI)

| Age / Group | Adequate Intake (AI) |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 0.01 mg/day |
| Infants 7–12 months | 0.5 mg/day |
| Children 1–3 years | 0.7 mg/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 1.0 mg/day |
| Children 9–13 years | 2.0 mg/day |
| Adolescents 14–18 years | 3.0 mg/day |
| Adult Men 19+ | 4.0 mg/day |
| Adult Women 19+ | 3.0 mg/day |
| Pregnant Women | 3.0 mg/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 3.0 mg/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 10 mg/day for adults; 1.3–2.2 mg/day for children (age-dependent), based on dental/skeletal fluorosis prevention.

## Functions
- **Dental Caries Prevention:** F⁻ incorporates into hydroxyapatite of tooth enamel → forms **fluorapatite** (Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆F₂) which is more resistant to acid (pH threshold 4.5 vs. 5.5 for hydroxyapatite). Fluoride also inhibits glycolysis by mutans streptococci, reducing acid production.
- **Remineralisation:** Fluoride enhances remineralisation of early carious lesions by promoting mineral deposition from saliva.
- **Bone Structure:** Fluoride in bone (as fluorapatite) increases crystal size and density; high-dose therapeutic use briefly explored for osteoporosis (limited due to adverse effects on bone quality).
- **Enzyme Inhibition:** At high concentrations, F⁻ inhibits enolase (glycolytic enzyme) — basis for its antibacterial effect; at toxic concentrations, inhibits multiple enzymes in human cells.

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Calcium** | Required for fluorapatite formation ([Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆F₂]) |
| **Phosphate** | Co-structural in fluorapatite |
| **Saliva** | Provides calcium and phosphate for remineralisation promoted by fluoride |

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | ~80–90% of soluble fluoride absorbed rapidly in stomach and small intestine |
| **Absorption reduced by** | Calcium, aluminium, and magnesium (form insoluble complexes) |
| **Distribution** | 99% in mineralised tissues (bone and teeth); rapid initial distribution to hard tissues |
| **Plasma peak** | ~30–60 minutes after ingestion |
| **Excretion** | Primarily renal (~50–60% within 24 hours); remainder deposited in bone; sweat and faeces minor |
| **Half-life (plasma)** | ~2–9 hours |

## Effects of Deficiency
Fluoride deficiency is not associated with essential biochemical dysfunction beyond dental effects.

**Manifestations:** Increased susceptibility to dental caries (cavities) — the primary and most clinically important consequence. Communities without water fluoridation or fluoride in diet have significantly higher caries rates.

**Note:** Unlike other minerals, fluoride deficiency does not cause a characteristic clinical syndrome beyond dental caries — it is therefore often termed a "conditional essential" mineral with primary dental rather than metabolic essentiality.

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Caries prevention (community) | Water fluoridation at 0.7 mg/L; fluoride toothpaste (1,000–1,500 ppm for adults, 1,000 ppm ages 3–6) |
| Caries prevention (high-risk child) | Fluoride varnish (22,600 ppm NaF) applied 2–4×/year by dental professional |
| Children in non-fluoridated areas | Fluoride supplements prescribed by dentist (0.25–1 mg/day based on age and water fluoride level) |
| Severe acute fluoride ingestion | Induce vomiting; calcium gluconate or milk to bind fluoride; IV calcium gluconate for hypocalcaemia |

---

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Calcium antacids / milk | Reduce fluoride absorption (form insoluble CaF₂) — avoid co-ingestion with fluoride supplements |
| Aluminium and magnesium antacids | Similarly reduce fluoride absorption |
| Ciprofloxacin and fluoroquinolones | Contain fluorine but not fluoride — unrelated to dietary fluoride toxicology |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Fluoride (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Fluoridated tap water | 1 L | ~0.7 mg |
| Tea (black, brewed) | 240 ml | 0.1–0.6 mg |
| Canned sardines (with bones) | 85g | ~0.2 mg |
| Shrimp | 85g | ~0.17 mg |
| Crab | 85g | ~0.21 mg |
| Grape juice / raisins | 240 ml / 145g | ~0.07–0.17 mg |
| Potatoes (boiled in fluoridated water) | 1 medium | ~0.05–0.10 mg |

> Most dietary fluoride comes from fluoridated drinking water and beverages made with it. Foods prepared with fluoridated water also contribute.

## Storage & Stability
- Fluoride is not degraded by cooking or storage. However, foods cooked in fluoridated water absorb additional fluoride.
- Fluoride concentrations in tea increase with steeping time.

## Toxicity

| Type | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Dental fluorosis** | Exposure during tooth development (0–8 years) → white spots, pitting, or brown staining of enamel; primarily cosmetic at mild–moderate levels |
| **Skeletal fluorosis** | Chronic very high intake (>10 mg/day for years) → bone pain, increased density, calcification of ligaments, osteosclerosis; seen in areas with naturally high fluoride water (>4 mg/L) |
| **Acute toxicity** | ~5 mg/kg body weight is lethal; as low as 1 mg/kg causes GI symptoms; symptoms: nausea, vomiting, hypocalcaemia, tetany, cardiac arrhythmia |
| **Thyroid** | Controversy exists; very high endemic fluoride areas associated with altered thyroid function in some studies; not established at public health fluoridation levels |
