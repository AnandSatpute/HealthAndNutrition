# Copper (Cu)

## Overview
Copper is an essential trace mineral and a **transition metal** that functions as a redox cofactor, cycling between Cu⁺ (cuprous) and Cu²⁺ (cupric) states. It is a key component of several critical enzymes involved in energy production, iron metabolism, antioxidant defence, neurotransmitter synthesis, and connective tissue formation. Total body copper is approximately 75–150 mg, distributed primarily in muscle, bone, liver, brain, and blood.

- **Atomic number:** 29; cycles Cu⁺ ↔ Cu²⁺
- **Category:** Trace mineral
- **Normal serum range:** 70–140 µg/dL (increases in pregnancy and inflammation as copper is an acute-phase reactant)

## Functions
- **Cytochrome c Oxidase (Complex IV):** Copper is essential in this terminal enzyme of the ETC — transfers electrons to O₂ to form water; critical for aerobic ATP synthesis.
- **Iron Metabolism (Ceruloplasmin):** Ceruloplasmin (a copper-containing ferroxidase) oxidises Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺, enabling iron loading onto transferrin for transport. Copper deficiency → functional iron deficiency anaemia.
- **Antioxidant Defence (SOD1):** Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) dismutates superoxide radicals (O₂⁻) to H₂O₂; found in cytoplasm. SOD2 (manganese-dependent) in mitochondria.
- **Connective Tissue Crosslinking (Lysyl Oxidase):** Copper enzyme crosslinks collagen and elastin fibres; deficiency causes aortic aneurysm, joint laxity, and fragile bone (Menkes-like effects).
- **Neurotransmitter Synthesis (Dopamine β-Hydroxylase):** Converts dopamine to norepinephrine; copper deficiency can impair the sympathetic nervous system.
- **Tyrosinase:** Copper enzyme required for melanin synthesis from tyrosine — deficiency → hypopigmentation.
- **Peptidylglycine α-Amidating Monooxygenase (PAM):** Activates neuropeptides (substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide) and peptide hormones.
- **Mitochondrial Biogenesis and ETC assembly:** Copper chaperone proteins (COX17, SCO1) are required for Complex IV assembly.

## Cofactors Needed

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Zinc** | Copper and zinc compete for absorption via metallothionein; balance is critical (Cu:Zn ratio normally ~1:10 in serum) |
| **Iron** | Operates downstream of copper in iron metabolism; functional iron deficiency occurs in copper deficiency |
| **Albumin and ceruloplasmin** | Copper transport proteins in plasma; ceruloplasmin carries ~95% of plasma copper |
| **Vitamin C (high dose)** | Can reduce copper absorption when taken in very high doses (>1,500 mg) |

---

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | 25–45% of dietary copper absorbed in stomach and proximal small intestine; via Ctr1 transporter |
| **Absorbed as** | Cu⁺ (cuprous); dietary Cu²⁺ reduced by stomach acid |
| **Distribution** | Liver (primary hub); bound to ceruloplasmin (~95% plasma copper); also albumin and macroglobulin (~5%) |
| **Metabolism** | Liver — excreted in bile (~95% of body copper turnover); ATP7B transporter essential for biliary copper export |
| **Excretion** | Primarily biliary/faecal; urinary copper minimal (<60 µg/day) unless chelation therapy |
| **Half-life** | ~2–5 weeks for hepatic copper pool |

## Effects of Deficiency
Copper deficiency is uncommon but clinically important.

**Causes:** Prolonged high-dose zinc supplementation (most common — zinc induces metallothionein which preferentially binds Cu), malabsorption (bariatric surgery, coeliac disease), excess formula-based feeding without copper supplementation.

**Symptoms:**
- **Haematological:** Anaemia (normocytic or macrocytic, sideroblastic — iron can not be loaded onto transferrin), neutropenia
- **Neurological:** Myelopathy (copper deficiency myelopathy — demyelination of posterior and lateral spinal columns, mimics subacute combined degeneration of vitamin B12 deficiency), peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, cognitive impairment
- **Connective tissue:** Weakened collagen and elastin — aortic aneurysm risk, skeletal abnormalities
- **Immunological:** Lymphopenia, increased infection susceptibility
- **Hypopigmentation:** Reduced melanin production

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Mild copper deficiency | Copper gluconate or copper sulfate 2 mg/day oral |
| Neurological copper deficiency | 2–4 mg/day elemental copper; may require IV copper initially |
| Zinc-induced copper deficiency | Stop or reduce zinc; copper 2 mg/day; neurological recovery partial |
| Wilson's disease (copper overload) | Penicillamine chelation (D-Pen), trientine, or zinc therapy (50 mg elemental TID blocks Cu absorption) |
| Menkes disease (Cu transporter defect) | SC copper-histidine injections (bypasses defective intestinal Ctr1) |

---

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Zinc (>50 mg elemental/day) | Induces intestinal metallothionein → sequesters copper → deficiency |
| Penicillamine | Chelates copper: used therapeutically in Wilson's; causes deficiency with long-term use |
| Vitamin C (>1,500 mg/day) | May reduce copper absorption and ceruloplasmin activity |
| Antacids | Alkaline pH may reduce Cu²⁺ absorption partially |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Copper (µg) |
|---|---|---|
| Beef liver (cooked) | 85g | ~12,400 µg |
| Oysters (cooked) | 85g | ~4,850 µg |
| Crab (Dungeness, cooked) | 85g | ~630 µg |
| Cashews | 28g | ~620 µg |
| Sunflower seeds | 28g | ~519 µg |
| Hazelnuts | 28g | ~496 µg |
| Dark chocolate (70–85%) | 28g | ~501 µg |
| Baked potato (flesh + skin) | 1 medium | ~610 µg |
| Mushrooms (shiitake, cooked) | 86g | ~650 µg |
| Lentils (cooked) | 90g | ~249 µg |

## Storage & Stability
- Copper content in foods is stable to cooking and storage.
- Copper can leach from copper pipes into drinking water — particularly in households with new copper plumbing and acidic water.

## Toxicity

| Condition | Details |
|---|---|
| Acute copper toxicity | Accidental ingestion of copper salts → nausea, vomiting, haemolytic anaemia, hepatic necrosis |
| Wilson's disease | Autosomal recessive (ATP7B mutation) — impaired biliary copper excretion → copper deposits in liver (cirrhosis), brain (neuropsychiatric symptoms), cornea (Kayser-Fleischer rings), kidneys |
| Indian childhood cirrhosis | High copper intake from brass vessel-stored milk → severe early hepatic copper overload |
| Chronic supplemental excess (>10 mg/day UL) | Hepatic injury, GI symptoms, haemolysis |

**Serum markers:** Ceruloplasmin and serum copper are usually low in deficiency (except in inflammation/pregnancy where they rise); 24-hour urine copper >100 µg/day + low ceruloplasmin + Kayser-Fleischer rings = Wilson's disease triad.
