# Beta-Alanine

## Overview
Beta-alanine (β-alanine) is a **non-proteinogenic β-amino acid** — meaning it is not used in protein synthesis — produced endogenously in the liver from the catabolism of carnosine, anserine, and β-aminoisobutyrate. It is the rate-limiting precursor for the synthesis of **carnosine** (β-alanyl-L-histidine) in skeletal muscle. Carnosine acts as an **intramuscular pH buffer**, hydrogen ion sink, and ROS scavenger, and is directly responsible for β-alanine's ergogenic effects. Beta-alanine is consistently recognised as one of the few sports supplements with a credible evidence base, particularly for **sustained high-intensity exercise lasting 1–10 minutes**.

- **Molecular formula:** C₃H₇NO₂ (MW = 89.09 g/mol)
- **Endogenous synthesis:** Small amount from pyrimidine catabolism (uracil → dihydrouracil → β-alanine) and from microbial fermentation in the gut
- **Rate-limiting step:** Carnosine synthase (CARNS1) condenses β-alanine + L-histidine → carnosine in muscle; β-alanine supply is the limiting factor (histidine is abundant)
- **Muscle carnosine:** Type II (fast-twitch) fibres have 2× higher carnosine than type I; men typically have 30–40% higher carnosine than women; sprint athletes have higher levels than endurance athletes

## Mechanism of Action

### Carnosine as pH Buffer
- During intense exercise, anaerobic glycolysis produces H⁺ (lactic acid dissociates to lactate⁻ + H⁺); intracellular pH drops from ~7.1 to ~6.6 at fatigue
- **Muscle acidosis** inhibits phosphofructokinase (PFK), actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling, and Ca²⁺ sensitivity of troponin → force production decreases
- Carnosine has a pKa of ~6.83 — optimally positioned to buffer H⁺ in the physiological exercise pH range
- At typical carnosine concentrations (20–40 mmol/kg dw), carnosine contributes ~7–16% of total intramuscular buffering capacity

### Additional Roles of Carnosine
| Role | Details |
|---|---|
| **Anti-glycation** | Carnosine reacts with reactive carbonyl species (methylglyoxal, acrolein) → prevents AGE (advanced glycation end product) formation → anti-senescent; lens carnosine (N-acetylcarnosine eye drops — cataracts) |
| **Ca²⁺ sensitivity** | Carnosine increases myofibrillar Ca²⁺ sensitivity at acidic pH → partially counteracts acidosis-induced desensitisation |
| **Zinc chelation** | Carnosine chelates Zn²⁺ → zinc-carnosine complex (polaprezinc) used clinically for gastric ulcer treatment and gut inflammation |
| **Antioxidant** | Scavenges ROS (•OH, HOCl, ¹O₂) in vitro; in vivo significance debated |

## Ergogenic Evidence

| Exercise Type | Effect | Duration Showing Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| **High-intensity cycling** | Increased time-to-exhaustion, higher peak power | 1–10 min |
| **Repeated sprint ability** | Reduced sprint time decay across multiple bouts | 30 s–4 min bouts |
| **Swimming** | Improved 200 m time performance | ~2 min |
| **Rowing** | Improved 2000 m time (≈6.5 min) | Sustained HIIT efforts |
| **Strength training (volume)** | Small increase in total volume-load at high rep ranges (15–25 rep sets) | Moderate intensity, high reps |
| **< 60-second efforts** | Minimal benefit (PCr/ATP system dominates before carnosine buffering relevant) | Insufficient duration |
| **Endurance (> 25 min)** | No significant benefit (aerobic metabolism; pH largely maintained) | Not indicated |

**Meta-analysis (Hobson et al., 2012; Saunders et al., 2017):** β-alanine supplementation increases muscle carnosine by **40–80%** over 4 weeks; ergogenic effects are small-to-moderate for exercises of 1–10 minutes (SMD ≈ 0.18–0.35).

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Well absorbed from small intestine via beta-amino acid transporter (PAT1, SLC36A1) |
| **Peak plasma** | 30–60 minutes post-dose |
| **Muscle uptake** | SLC6A6 (taurine transporter) imports β-alanine into muscle; rate-limited by transporter kinetics |
| **Loading duration** | Minimum 4 weeks for significant carnosine elevation; 10–12 weeks for maximum (+80%) |
| **Washout** | Carnosine returns to baseline over ~15 weeks after stopping; washout slower than loading |
| **Dose–response** | 3.2 g/day vs. 6.4 g/day: both elevate carnosine; higher dose elevates faster but equal final levels at 24 weeks |
| **Paresthesia (tingling)** | Most common side effect — dose-dependent peripheral tingling (face, hands, extremities) caused by β-alanine binding MRGPRD receptors on cutaneous sensory neurons; harmless but bothersome |

### Managing Paresthesia
- Use **sustained-release (SR) formulations** — most effective approach; reduces peak plasma levels → eliminates or greatly reduces tingling
- Split dosing (4 × 0.8 g throughout day) achieves similar result
- No health risk from paresthesia; fully resolves within 60–90 minutes

## Dietary Sources

| Source | β-Alanine Content |
|---|---|
| **Chicken breast (cooked)** | ~350 mg/100 g (from carnosine hydrolysis in cooked meat) |
| **Beef (lean)** | ~300 mg/100 g |
| **Pork** | ~250 mg/100 g |
| **Tuna** | ~200 mg/100 g |
| **Vegetables / plant foods** | Negligible |

> **Note:** Dietary carnosine (from meat) is hydrolysed in the GI tract to β-alanine + histidine → β-alanine absorbed and remade into carnosine in muscle. Vegetarians have significantly lower muscle carnosine (~20–30% lower) and respond better to supplementation.

## Clinical Relevance

### Exercise Capacity in Elderly
- Older adults have ~30–40% lower muscle carnosine than young adults; associated with reduced buffering capacity and exercise tolerance
- β-Alanine (3.2 g/day × 12 weeks) increases carnosine and improves exercise performance in adults >55 years (ISSN recommendation)

### Type 2 Diabetes / Insulin Resistance
- Carnosine has anti-glycation and anti-AGE properties — preliminary human data show reduced HbA1c with carnosine supplementation; β-alanine as precursor under investigation
- Polaprezinc (Zn-carnosine) improves gut permeability in T2DM patients

### Psychiatric Conditions
- Carnosine as dipeptide crosses the BBB; zinc-carnosine combinations studied in autism (carnosine supplementation improved autism severity scales in pilot RCT, Sokol et al., 2001) — results not convincingly replicated

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Creatine** | Complementary, not competing; creatine targets PCr system (0–15 s); β-alanine targets H⁺ buffering (1–10 min); commonly combined in pre-workout formulations |
| **Histidine** | High histidine intake does not further increase carnosine (β-alanine is rate-limiting, not histidine, in normal diet); excess histidine can even competitively inhibit CARNS1 |
| **Taurine** | Both β-alanine and taurine use SLC6A6 for transport; very high β-alanine supplementation may reduce taurine uptake into tissues; clinical significance unknown at typical supplement doses |
| **Training volume** | Training increases carnosine synthesis and turnover; trained athletes have higher baseline carnosine and greater response rate to supplementation |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Dose:** 3.2–6.4 g/day; sustained-release preferred; 4 weeks minimum, 10–12 weeks for full effect
- **Form:** Sustained-release tablets (e.g., CarnoSyn SR) best for paresthesia management; powder in split doses acceptable
- **Timing:** Not time-sensitive; any time of day; taking with food reduces GI discomfort
- **Combination:** Often combined with creatine monohydrate — complementary energy system coverage; creatine + β-alanine RCTs show additive lean mass and performance benefits (Hoffman et al., 2006)
- **Who benefits most:** Athletes competing in 1–10 minute events (800 m–3 km running, 100–400 m swimming, cycling time trials, wrestling, rowing); team sport athletes with repeated high-intensity bouts
- **Safety:** No adverse effects beyond paresthesia; no long-term safety concerns identified; WADA-permitted
