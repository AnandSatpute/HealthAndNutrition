# Caffeine

## Overview
Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive substance and one of the most rigorously studied ergogenic aids in sports nutrition. It is a naturally occurring methylxanthine alkaloid found in coffee, tea, cocoa, guaraná, and yerba maté. Caffeine acts primarily as a **competitive antagonist of adenosine receptors** (A₁ and A₂A subtypes) in the CNS and peripheral tissues, blunting adenosine's inhibitory/fatigue-promoting effects. It is effective across virtually all exercise modalities — endurance, strength, power, team sports — and remains one of the **only legal ergogenic aids with performance benefits across a broad dose range (3–6 mg/kg)**.

- **Molecular formula:** C₈H₁₀N₄O₂ (MW = 194.19 g/mol)
- **Classification:** Methylxanthine; mild CNS stimulant; A₁/A₂A adenosine receptor antagonist
- **Natural sources:** Coffee, tea, cocoa, guaraná seeds, yerba maté, kola nuts
- **Regulatory status:** Removed from WADA prohibited list in 2004 (previously banned at >12 μg/mL urinary); currently WADA-permitted but on monitoring program; legal worldwide

## Mechanisms of Action

| Mechanism | Details |
|---|---|
| **Adenosine receptor antagonism** | Adenosine accumulates during exercise → binds A₁ (inhibits cAMP → reduces alertness, increases sleep drive) and A₂A receptors → fatigue, sedation; caffeine blocks both non-competitively → increases neuronal firing, reduces pain perception (RPE), promotes wakefulness |
| **Catecholamine release** | A₁ antagonism in sympathetic ganglia → enhanced epinephrine and norepinephrine release → increased heart rate, cardiac output, lipolysis, glycogenolysis |
| **Phosphodiesterase inhibition** | At high concentrations (>100 μmol/L, well above typical supplementation), inhibits PDE → prevents cAMP degradation → amplified cAMP signalling; minor contribution at normal doses |
| **Ryanodine receptor sensitisation** | Caffeine sensitises RyR1/RyR2 → enhanced Ca²⁺ release from SR → increased myofibrillar Ca²⁺ availability → enhanced muscle force production (seen in isolated muscle; less certain in vivo) |
| **Fat oxidation** | Epinephrine-mediated activation of HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase) → increased FFA mobilisation → spares muscle glycogen (particularly at moderate intensities); most relevant in fasted state |
| **Pain/RPE reduction** | Central A₁ antagonism in pain circuits → reduced ratings of perceived exertion → athletes can sustain higher intensities subjectively; μ-opioid pathway interaction |

## Ergogenic Evidence

| Performance Domain | Effect | Effect Size |
|---|---|---|
| **Endurance (cycling, running TT)** | ~2–4% improvement in time trial performance | Moderate (SMD ~0.4) |
| **Muscular strength (1-RM)** | ~1–3% increase in 1-RM strength | Small |
| **Muscular endurance (reps to failure)** | ~10–20% more reps at submaximal loads | Moderate |
| **Sprint power** | ~3–5% increase in peak power output | Moderate |
| **Team sport performance** | Improved sprint speed, jumping, skill accuracy under fatigue | Moderate |
| **Cognitive performance** | Significant improvement in sustained attention, reaction time, vigilance — most robust effect | Large |
| **Grip strength** | Small but significant increases | Small |
| **Sleep deprivation compensation** | Largely restores cognitive and physical performance lost to 24h sleep deprivation | Large |

**Meta-analysis (Grgic et al., 2019; Southward et al., 2018):** Effect size for endurance performance: ES = 0.40 (95% CI 0.26–0.55); strongest effects in aerobic events lasting 5–60 minutes.

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Rapidly absorbed from GI tract; F ≈ 99%; peak plasma at 30–60 min (tablets/powder); energy drinks 45–60 min |
| **Half-life** | 3–5 hours (adults); highly variable — CYP1A2 rapid metabolisers (smokers, CYP1A2*1F AA) clear caffeine ~2× faster; slow metabolisers (CY1A2 AC or CC) clear more slowly |
| **Distribution** | V_d ≈ 0.6 L/kg; crosses BBB and placenta; ~25–36% plasma protein bound |
| **Metabolism** | Hepatic CYP1A2 → paraxanthine (84%, active), theobromine (12%), theophylline (4%) |
| **Elimination** | Renal; caffeine found in urine at detectable levels 10+ hours after ingestion |
| **Habitual consumption** | Adenosine receptor upregulation with chronic caffeine use → tolerance of stimulant and ergogenic effects; **acute abstinence (3–4 day washout) before competition maximises ergogenic response** |

| **Guaraná supplement** | Variable; ~40–80 mg per capsule |
| **Caffeine anhydrous tablet (200 mg)** | Most precise and rapidly absorbed form |

## Clinical Relevance

### CYP1A2 Pharmacogenomics and Cardiovascular Risk
- *NEJM* 2006 (Cornelis et al.): CYP1A2 slow metabolisers (AC/CC) homozygous → slower caffeine clearance → elevated plasma levels → increased MI risk with >4 cups/day coffee; fast metabolisers (AA) showed no increased risk and even reduced MI risk at moderate intake
- **Clinical importance:** Genetic testing for CYP1A2 alleles may personalise caffeine recommendations for high-risk cardiac patients and athletes

### Anxiogenic Effects
- Caffeine increases amygdala activity and sympathetic arousal; at doses >400 mg, can precipitate or worsen generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic attacks, and tachyarrhythmias in susceptible individuals
- Vulnerability increased with ADORA2A (adenosine A₂A receptor) genetic variants (affecting anxiogenic response)

### Bone Mineral Density
- Very high caffeine intake (>800 mg/day) associated with marginally reduced calcium absorption (~5 mg Ca per 150 mg caffeine); compensated by adequate calcium intake; not clinically significant at normal intake

### Pregnancy
- Current guidelines: limit to <200 mg/day during pregnancy (WHO, ACOG); caffeine crosses placenta; fetal CYP1A2 absent → accumulates; associated with low birth weight at high intake

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Creatine** | No confirmed antagonism; early concern based on one study not replicated; safe to combine |
| **Beta-alanine** | No pharmacokinetic interaction; often combined in pre-workout (different mechanisms, complementary) |
| **Alcohol** | Caffeine masks alcohol's sedative effects but does not reduce impairment of psychomotor skills → false sense of sobriety → dangerous combination |
| **Adenosine agonists (adenosine infusion, regadenoson)** | Caffeine blocks adenosine cardiac vasodilation during myocardial perfusion imaging → false negative stress test; must stop caffeine 12–24 h before |
| **Oral contraceptives / fluvoxamine** | CYP1A2 inhibition → elevated caffeine levels → increased side effects; consider dose reduction |
| **Fluoroquinolone antibiotics (ciprofloxacin)** | CYP1A2 inhibitor → significantly raises caffeine plasma levels — caution with concurrent use |
| **Nicotine** | CYP1A2 inducer; smokers metabolise caffeine ~2× faster → lower plasma levels per dose |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Optimal dose:** **3–6 mg/kg body weight** (typically 200–400 mg); doses above 9 mg/kg produce no additional ergogenic benefit but significantly more side effects
- **Timing:** Consume 45–60 minutes before exercise to align peak plasma level with effort; some ultra-endurance athletes use caffeine later in events (mid-race supplementation) to offset central fatigue
- **Tolerance management:** Cycle caffeine; use 3–5 day washout before key competitions to maximise effect; avoid daily supplemental doses if competition performance is the goal
- **Form:** Caffeine anhydrous (tablet/capsule/powder) = most consistent and reliable pharmacokinetics; coffee is effective but variable; energy drinks are effective but often contain other ingredients
- **Sensitive individuals:** Start with 100 mg to assess tolerance; avoid within 8 hours of sleep (half-life 5h → 10% remains at 16h)
- **Rhabdomyolysis risk:** Rare but documented cases with very high-dose caffeine powder ingestion (>5 g) — avoid bulk caffeine powder (tablespoon = potentially lethal dose); use pre-measured capsules
