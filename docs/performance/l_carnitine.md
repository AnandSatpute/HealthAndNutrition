# L-Carnitine

## Overview
L-Carnitine is a **naturally occurring amino acid derivative** synthesised endogenously in the liver and kidneys predominantly from lysine and methionine, with ascorbate (Vitamin C), niacin (Vitamin B3), pyridoxine (Vitamin B6), and iron as essential cofactors. Its primary biological role is the **transport of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) across the inner mitochondrial membrane** for β-oxidation — an essential step because LCFA cannot cross this membrane freely. Approximately 95–98% of body carnitine is found in skeletal and cardiac muscle. While carnitine occupies a central role in fat metabolism, evidence for ergogenic effects in athletes with normal carnitine status is considerably more nuanced than its popularity suggests.

- **Molecular formula:** C₇H₁₅NO₃ (MW = 161.20 g/mol)
- **Classification:** Amino acid derivative / conditionally essential nutrient (essential in preterm neonates, and conditionally in certain metabolic disorders)
- **Endogenous synthesis rate:** ~1.2 μmol/kg/day; adequate in healthy adults; dependent on adequate lysine, methionine, Fe, ascorbate, niacin, B6
- **Body pool:** ~25 g (70 kg male); 97–98% in skeletal muscle (>3000:1 concentration ratio muscle:plasma)
- **Forms:** Free carnitine (FC) + acylcarnitines; short, medium, and long-chain acylcarnitines serve as metabolite buffers and overflow valves

## Functions

| Function | Details |
|---|---|
| **Long-chain fatty acid transport** | Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I, outer membrane) + translocase + CPT-II (inner membrane): converts LCFA-CoA → acylcarnitine → transports across inner mitochondrial membrane → regenerates LCFA-CoA inside for β-oxidation |
| **Acetyl-CoA buffering** | Acetylcarnitine transfers acetyl groups out of mitochondria → free CoA recycled → maintains mitochondrial CoA availability during high metabolic rate; "CoA sink" hypothesis |
| **Reducing acylcarnitine overflow** | When β-oxidation is overwhelmed (T2DM, VLCAD deficiency), acylcarnitines accumulate → carnitine supplementation buffers excess acyl groups → reduces toxic accumulation |
| **Modulates glucose oxidation** | By controlling acetyl-CoA flux and PDC activity via acetylcarnitine, carnitine affects the balance of fat vs. glucose oxidation |
| **Antioxidant role** | Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) specifically: reduces mitochondrial ROS production, maintains electron transport chain efficiency, reduces lipid peroxidation in ageing neurons |

## Forms of Carnitine

| Form | Key Uses / Properties |
|---|---|
| **L-Carnitine tartrate** | Preferred for exercise performance; fast absorption; most studied athletic form |
| **Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR)** | Crosses BBB; primarily used for cognitive function, neuroprotection, peripheral neuropathy; acetyl group donated to acetylcholine synthesis |
| **Propionyl-L-carnitine (PLC)** | Studied in peripheral artery disease and heart failure; improves exercise tolerance in cardiovascular disease |
| **L-Carnitine L-tartrate (LCLT)** | Reduces exercise-induced muscle damage markers; preferred in acute exercise damage protocols |
| **Glycine propionyl-L-carnitine (GPLC)** | Increases nitric oxide bioavailability → potential vasodilatory effect; emerging data in intermittent claudication |

## Ergogenic Evidence

| Performance Outcome | Effect | Evidence Quality |
|---|---|---|
| **Fat oxidation (trained athletes)** | No significant increase at physiological oral doses without insulin manipulation; muscle carnitine does not increase with standard oral supplementation alone | Well-established |
| **Fat oxidation (with insulin)** | Wall et al., 2011 (*JPhysiol*): 24 weeks of L-carnitine + CHO (80 g insulin spike before dose) → ~21% increase in muscle carnitine → significantly spared glycogen and reduced lactate at submaximal exercise | **Strong** (mechanistic RCT) |
| **Exercise capacity in PAD** | Propionyl-L-carnitine: Cochrane review confirms improved walking performance in peripheral artery disease | **Moderate** |
| **Heart failure exercise tolerance** | Carnitine reduces symptoms and improves VO₂max in heart failure patients | **Moderate** |
| **Muscle damage/recovery** | LCLT (2 g/day): reduces exercise-induced DOMS, plasma myoglobin, creatine kinase, and MDA in multiple RCTs | **Moderate** |
| **Weight loss/body composition** | Modest evidence; meta-analysis (Pooyandjoo et al., 2016): −1.33 kg body weight vs. placebo; effect strongest with concomitant caloric restriction | **Small** |
| **Healthy athletes fat oxidation** | No meaningful effect at oral doses without insulin co-ingestion | **Well established (null)** |

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Oral bioavailability** | ~14–18% in omnivores (extensive colonic microbial competition and degradation); ~68–86% in vegans (gut microbiome less adapted to carnitine metabolism, less TMAO production) |
| **TMAO production** | Colonic bacteria (*Acinetobacter*, *Pseudomonas*) convert carnitine → TMA → hepatic FMO3 → trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO); elevated TMAO associated with increased CVD risk in some epidemiological studies (Hall et al.); causality debated |
| **Absorption route** | Active transport via OCTN2 (SLC22A5) transporter in small intestine |
| **IV vs. oral** | IV carnitine achieves rapid plasma elevation; oral doses primarily raise plasma, not muscle, unless combined with insulin elevation |
| **Insulin dependency for muscle uptake** | OCTN2 in muscle is insulin-sensitive → chronic hyperinsulinaemia needed for prolonged muscle carnitine accumulation (explains Wall et al. protocol) |

## Dietary Sources

| Source | L-Carnitine Content |
|---|---|
| **Beef steak (raw, 100 g)** | 56–162 mg |
| **Pork (cooked, 85 g)** | 24–35 mg |
| **Chicken breast (85 g)** | 3–5 mg |
| **Whole milk (240 mL)** | 8 mg |
| **Cod fish (85 g)** | 4–7 mg |
| **Avocado (100 g)** | 2 mg |
| **Plant foods generally** | <1 mg — vegans have 50–70% lower plasma carnitine than omnivores |

## Clinical Relevance

### Primary Carnitine Deficiency (PCD)
- Autosomal recessive OCTN2 loss-of-function mutation (SLC22A5 gene) → carnitine not reabsorbed by kidneys → urinary wasting → profound plasma and tissue carnitine depletion
- Presents as: dilated cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, hypoketotic hypoglycaemia in infants/children
- Treatment: L-carnitine supplementation 100–300 mg/kg/day; dramatic clinical response; lifelong treatment required

### Secondary Carnitine Deficiency
- Causes: renal failure (dialysis removes carnitine), valproate therapy (anti-epileptic binds carnitine → increased urinary loss, hepatotoxicity), HIV treatment (NRTI drugs), preterm neonates (insufficient endogenous synthesis)
- Treatment: L-carnitine supplementation; renally tailored dosing

### Cognitive Function (ALCAR)
- ALCAR (1.5–3 g/day) improves mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease in multiple trials; modest but consistent effect on cognitive speed and attention
- Reduces carnitine deficiency in aging neurons; improves mitochondrial function

### Peripheral Neuropathy
- ALCAR (500–1000 mg × 3/day): reduces neuropathic pain and improves nerve conduction in diabetic, HIV, and cisplatin-induced neuropathy — meta-analysis confirms analgesic effect
- FDA has not approved for neuropathy, but commonly recommended by integrative medicine specialists

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Valproate/Valproic acid** | Significantly increases urinary carnitine excretion → symptomatic deficiency in some patients; supplement L-carnitine when on long-term valproate (50–100 mg/kg/day) |
| **Thyroid hormones** | Carnitine antagonises thyroid hormone action (possibly by blocking nuclear receptor entry) → useful in hyperthyroidism-induced bone loss |
| **Anticoagulants (acenocoumarol)** | Case reports of elevated INR with carnitine supplementation; warfarin interaction less well-documented; monitor INR |
| **Insulin** | Required for muscle carnitine uptake; low insulin states (fasting, T1DM) impair muscle carnitine accumulation from oral supplements |
| **TMAO / gut microbiome** | Carnitine → TMA → TMAO via gut bacteria; high TMAO associated with CVD events in some studies; vegan gut microbiome produces far less TMAO from same carnitine dose |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Standard dose:** 1–3 g/day (as free carnitine or L-carnitine tartrate)
- **For fat oxidation in athletes:** Combine with 80 g simple carbohydratesto trigger insulin; 24-week loading required for muscle accumulation (Wall et al. protocol)
- **For cognitive function:** Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) 1.5–2 g/day; crosses BBB effectively
- **For muscle damage/recovery:** L-Carnitine L-Tartrate (LCLT) 2–4 g/day peri-workout
- **Timing:** With meals; fat vs. glucose meal may not matter significantly for plasma absorption
- **Vegans:** Lower baseline → higher bioavailability per dose → potentially better candidates for ergogenic protocols; supplementation 500–2000 mg/day commonly recommended
- **Safety:** Generally very safe; GI upset (nausea, diarrhoea) at >3 g/day; fishy body odour from TMA in some individuals; TMAO concern theoretically but clinical significance of supplementation-dose TMAO unclear
