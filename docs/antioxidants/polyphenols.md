# Polyphenols

## Overview
Polyphenols are the largest and most structurally diverse class of plant secondary metabolites, with over **8,000 identified structures**. Defined by the presence of multiple phenolic hydroxyl groups (-OH) attached to aromatic rings, polyphenols serve plants as UV protectants, antimicrobial defences, and pigments. In the human diet, they are ubiquitous in fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, cocoa, red wine, olive oil, and whole grains. Polyphenols are **not classified as essential nutrients** — no deficiency syndrome is described — but high polyphenol intake from plant-rich diets is consistently and strongly associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, and certain cancers across epidemiological studies.

- **Classification:** Secondary plant metabolites; non-essential bioactive compounds; 4 major structural classes + hundreds of subclasses
- **Key property:** Antioxidant via direct radical scavenging, metal chelation, and most importantly through **modulation of antioxidant and inflammatory gene signalling** (Nrf2, NF-κB, MAPK pathways)
- **Bioavailability challenge:** Most polyphenols are extensively modified by gut microbiota and phase II metabolism; systemic bioavailability of parent compounds is often <1–5%, but gut-derived metabolites have significant local intestinal effects and some are bioavailable systemically
- **Food vs. supplement distinction:** Whole food polyphenol effects are consistently stronger in trials than isolated polyphenol supplements — food matrix effects, polyphenol synergy, and gut microbiome interactions are critical

## Mechanisms of Action — Overview

| Mechanism | Details |
|---|---|
| **Direct antioxidant / radical scavenging** | Phenolic –OH groups donate H• to quench lipid, hydroxyl, peroxyl, superoxide radicals; forms relatively stable phenoxyl radical; less important than once thought relative to signalling effects |
| **Metal chelation** | Polyphenols chelate Fe²⁺ and Cu²⁺ → inhibit Fenton reaction (Fe²⁺ + H₂O₂ → Fe³⁺ + OH• + OH⁻) → reduce hydroxyl radical generation |
| **Nrf2 activation** | Many polyphenols activate Nrf2 (often via autoxidation to electrophilic quinones → Keap1 modification) → upregulate glutathione synthesis, heme-oxygenase-1, SOD, catalase |
| **NF-κB inhibition** | Suppress IκB kinase (IKK) phosphorylation → prevent NF-κB nuclear translocation → reduce TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, COX-2, iNOS gene expression |
| **AMPK activation** | Multiple polyphenols mimic caloric restriction via AMPK activation (EGCG, quercetin, resveratrol) → improve insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial biogenesis |
| **eNOS upregulation** | Flavanols (especially epicatechin from cocoa) activate eNOS → increased NO production → vasodilation → blood pressure reduction; explains "flavanol-mediated flow-mediated dilation" |
| **Gut microbiome modulation** | Polyphenols are partly prebiotic — selectively feed beneficial gut bacteria (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium; Akkermansia); gut bacteria metabolise polyphenols to bioactive metabolites (urolithins from ellagitannins, equol from isoflavones) that have systemic effects |

## Major Classes — Detailed Notes

### Phenolic Acids
- **Chlorogenic acid** (major coffee polyphenol): Abundant in green coffee beans (3–5 g per cup of instant coffee); inhibits hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase → reduces fasting glucose; improves insulin sensitivity; the primary mechanism behind coffee's well-documented protection against T2DM and liver disease
- **Ferulic acid** (major whole grain phenolic acid): Primarily in wheat bran (esterified to arabinoxylan); anti-inflammatory; crosses blood-brain barrier; studied for neuroprotection in Alzheimer's models
- **Gallic acid** (tannin monomer): Found in gallotannins; potent antioxidant; antimicrobial; prostate cancer apoptosis in vitro
- **Ellagic acid** and **ellagitannins** → colonic bacteria → **urolithins (Urolithin A, B, C, D)**: Urolithin A has emerged as a significant postbiotic — activates mitophagy (mitochondrial recycling), extends lifespan in C. elegans and mice; clinical trial (TRIIM): Urolithin A supplement improved muscle mitochondrial health in older adults

### Tannins
- **Proanthocyanidins (OPCs):** Oligomeric proanthocyanidins in grape seed extract, red wine, cranberry, cocoa; inhibit bacterial adhesion to uroepithelium (basis for cranberry and UTI prevention); potent free radical scavengers; modest LDL-C lowering
- **Ellagitannins (pomegranate, walnuts, berries):** Hydrolysed by gut bacteria to ellagic acid → urolithins; pomegranate juice (POJ) has strongest antioxidant capacity of commonly consumed juices (3× red wine, 5× green tea per gram)
- **Hydrolysable tannins contribute significantly to the antioxidant capacity of pomegranate, strawberries, raspberries, and oak-barrel-aged red wine**

### Lignans
- **Food sources:** Flaxseed (richest — ~300 mg secoisolariciresinol diglucoside per 100 g), sesame seeds, whole grains, cruciferous vegetables
- **Gut metabolism:** Intestinal bacteria convert plant lignans → **enterolignans (enterodiol, enterolactone)** — phytoestrogenic activity via ERα/ERβ; associated with reduced risk of hormone-sensitive cancers (breast, prostate) in epidemiological studies
- **Cardiovascular:** Flaxseed lignans reduce LDL-C and inflammatory markers in RCTs; enterolactone is inversely associated with cardiovascular mortality in cohort studies

### Curcumin
- **Source:** Turmeric (*Curcuma longa*), comprising ~2–5% of dry turmeric mass
- **Bioavailability problem:** Curcumin is extremely poorly absorbed (rapid conjugation and first-pass metabolism); typical plasma levels from 1 g curcumin are ~1–4 ng/mL (barely detectable); the vast majority of tested clinical benefits from dietary turmeric are limited by this
- **Bioavailability solutions:** Piperine (BioPerine, 5–20 mg) inhibits glucuronidation → increases bioavailability 20-fold; phospholipid complex (Meriva, Phytosome) — 29-fold better; nanoparticle encapsulation; liposomal curcumin
- **Mechanisms:** EXTREMELY broad in vitro mechanistic targets (NF-κB, Nrf2, STAT3, AP-1, p53, mTOR, Wnt, HDAC — nearly every cancer-relevant pathway); this breadth is sometimes called the "curcumin promiscuity problem" — it may be a PAINS (pan-assay interference) compound with artifactual results in many assays
- **Clinical evidence:** Promising for osteoarthritis pain (equivalent to NSAIDs in some trials at 500 mg 3× daily of bioavailable forms); IBD and IBS remission maintenance; some cancer biomarker studies; no approved clinical indication
- **Hydroxytyrosol (olive):** A simpler phenol in EVOO; among the most potent antioxidants measured (ORAC); contributes to EVOO's cardiovascular benefits; EFSA approved health claim: "Olive oil polyphenols contribute to the protection of blood lipids from oxidative stress" (at ≥5 mg hydroxytyrosol + derivatives per 20 g EVOO)

## Clinical Relevance

### Cardiovascular Disease
- Significant and consistent epidemiological evidence: Mediterranean and MIND diets (polyphenol-rich) reduce CVD incidence by 30–40% (PREDIMED, >7,000 participants)
- Cocoa flavanols (700 mg/day): multiple RCTs → improved endothelial function (FMD), blood pressure reduction, platelet aggregation inhibition
- Olive oil polyphenols (hydroxytyrosol + oleuropein): EFSA-approved claim; reduce oxidised LDL

### Type 2 Diabetes
- 3–4 cups/day coffee (polyphenol-rich): 25–30% lower T2DM risk in meta-analyses (both caffeinated and decaffeinated — chlorogenic acid is the active component, not caffeine)
- Berberine (an alkaloid polyphenol from Berberis plants; 500 mg 3×/day): clinically comparable to metformin for T2DM glucose management across multiple Chinese RCTs; activates AMPK, reduces hepatic glucose output

### Gut Microbiome (Prebiotic Effects)
- Polyphenols selectively increase Akkermansia muciniphila (associated with metabolic health), Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and reduce Bacteroidetes overgrowth
- Red wine polyphenols (in <250 mL/day amounts) significantly change gut microbiome composition within 4 weeks

### Cancer Chemoprevention
- Epidemiological associations for multiple cancers with polyphenol-rich diets; direct intervention evidence limited
- Green tea catechins (EGCG): reduce prostate cancer recurrence in high-risk men in a landmark Italian RCT (600 mg/day green tea catechins → 30% prostate cancer incidence reduction vs control at 1 year)

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Non-haem iron absorption** | Polyphenols (especially tannins, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid) bind non-haem iron → inhibit absorption by up to 60–70%; avoid high-polyphenol beverages (tea, coffee) with iron-rich meals if iron-deficient |
| **Gut microbiome** | Polyphenol effects are largely microbiome-mediated; antibiotic use abolishes many polyphenol benefits; individual response to polyphenols is highly microbiome-dependent |
| **Drugs metabolised by CYP450** | Grapefruit polyphenols (furanocoumarins — naringenin) strongly inhibit CYP3A4 → dangerous increases in many drug plasma levels (statins, calcium channel blockers, immunosuppressants) |
| **Warfarin** | Multiple polyphenols (quercetin, EGCG, resveratrol) have anticoagulant/anti-platelet effects; polyphenol-rich supplements may potentiate warfarin; monitor INR |
| **Thyroid medications** | Isoflavones (soy) may impair levothyroxine absorption — separate by at least 4 hours |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Whole food approach is strongly preferred** — synergistic food matrix effects are repeatedly evident in trials vs. isolated polyphenols
- **Cocoa flavanols (700 mg/day):** Best evidence; CocoaVia and similar products provide standardised flavanol doses; CVD endpoint study (COSMOS-Heart: 21,442 people, 3.6 years): 500 mg/day cocoa extract → 27% reduction in CVD death (major RCT)
- **Green tea extract (EGCG; 400–800 mg/day):** Antioxidant and metabolic benefits; hepatotoxicity risk at >800 mg/day EGCG on empty stomach — take with food; stimulant effects from caffeine
- **Pomegranate extract (standardised to ellagitannins):** 250–1,000 mg/day; prostate cancer interest, urolithin A production; no significant drug interactions at food doses
- **Grape seed extract (OPCs; 100–300 mg/day):** Modest LDL-C reduction; anti-inflammatory; chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) — evidence-based in European guidelines
- **Berberine (500 mg 3×/day with meals):** Strong evidence for T2DM; also studied for NAFLD, lipid lowering (reduces LDL-C ~20%), PCOS; gastrointestinal side effects common; inhibits CYP3A4 — drug interaction monitoring required
- **Urolithin A (500–1,000 mg/day):** Emerging supplement for mitochondrial health and muscle function in elderly; Amazentis (Timeline Nutrition) is the primary commercial form; Phase II RCTs positive for muscle mitochondrial function
