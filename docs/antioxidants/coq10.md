# Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10 / Ubiquinone)

## Overview
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), also known as **ubiquinone** (from *ubiquitous quinone*), is a fat-soluble, vitamin-like compound found in every cell in the human body, with the highest concentrations in mitochondria-rich organs: heart, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. It is **endogenously synthesised** via the mevalonate pathway (shared with cholesterol synthesis), making it non-essential in healthy individuals. CoQ10 serves two fundamental roles: as a **mobile electron carrier** in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), and as the **only endogenous lipid-soluble antioxidant** generated by the body itself — protecting cell membranes and mitochondrial membranes from lipid peroxidation.

- **Type:** Fat-soluble quinone; endogenously synthesised; found in all cells
- **Redox forms:** Ubiquinone (CoQ; fully oxidised), Ubisemiquinone (CoQ•; radical intermediate), **Ubiquinol (CoQH₂; fully reduced, antioxidant form)**
- **Structure:** Benzoquinone ring + isoprenoid side chain (10 isoprene units in humans; coenzyme Q**10**)
- **Key fact:** Biosynthesis uses the same mevalonate pathway as cholesterol; **statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase → reduce both cholesterol AND CoQ10 synthesis**

## Biosynthesis

| Stage | Key Enzyme / Pathway | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Mevalonate pathway** | HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) — rate-limiting | Acetyl-CoA → mevalonate → IPP → farnesyl-PP → (shared with cholesterol synthesis) → decaprenyl-PP (10-unit tail of CoQ10) |
| **Quinone ring synthesis** | Tyrosine → 4-hydroxybenzoate (via PAH/ADCK3 pathway) | Provides the benzoquinone ring head group |
| **Assembly** | COQ complex (COQ3–COQ9 enzymes) | Assembly of head group + tail → CoQ10 in the inner mitochondrial membrane |

> **Statin effect:** Statins inhibit HMGCR → reduce synthesis of both mevalonate-derived cholesterol AND the isoprenoid tail of CoQ10. CoQ10 plasma levels fall 16–54% with intensive statin therapy. This biochemical fact is mechanistically plausible as a contribution to statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), though clinical evidence remains debated.

## Functions

### Electron Transport Chain (Primary Role)
- CoQ10 is the **mobile hydrophobic electron shuttle** between Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) and Complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex) in the inner mitochondrial membrane
- Complex I → CoQ10 (ubiquinone + 2e⁻ + 2H⁺ → ubiquinol); Complex III → accepts electrons from ubiquinol → regenerates ubiquinone
- Net: CoQ10 cycling in ETC is essential for ~95% of cellular ATP through oxidative phosphorylation

### Antioxidant Functions
- **Ubiquinol (CoQH₂)** is the most potent known lipid-soluble antioxidant in biological membranes
- Directly quenches superoxide, lipid peroxyl radicals, peroxynitrite in the mitochondrial and cell membranes
- Regenerates **vitamin E** (tocopheryl radical → α-tocopherol) by donating electrons — CoQ10 is upstream of vitamin E in the membrane antioxidant hierarchy
- Prevents oxidative modification of LDL cholesterol (CoQ10-enriched LDL is more resistant to oxidation)

### Other Functions
- **NF-κB inhibition:** Ubiquinol downregulates NF-κB-mediated inflammatory gene expression (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) at the transcriptional level
- **Membrane integrity:** Maintains mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm); CoQ10 interacts with uncoupling proteins (UCPs) to regulate proton leak
- **Sulphide oxidation:** CoQ10 is the electron acceptor for sulphide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) — the enzyme that detoxifies hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) in mitochondria; relevant in gut bacterially-producing H₂S environments

## Metabolism and Bioavailability

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Endogenous synthesis** | Produced in liver and other tissues via mevalonate pathway; peak production at age ~20, declines ~0.5%/year thereafter |
| **Dietary absorption** | Absorbed in the small intestine with dietary fat; incorporated into chylomicrons → lymph → plasma; fat-containing meals significantly improve CoQ10 absorption |
| **Plasma transport** | Primarily carried in LDL and HDL; oxidised to ubiquinol in plasma; plasma CoQ10 correlates with LDL particle number (not independent) |
| **Tissue distribution** | Heart >> liver >> kidney >> skeletal muscle >> brain > lung > plasma; cardiac CoQ10 declines significantly in heart failure |
| **Bioavailability of supplements** | Standard crystal form: poor (hydrophobic, poor dissolution); **solubilised/soft-gel formulations (ubiquinol or solubilised ubiquinone)** achieve 3–4× higher plasma levels vs crystal powder |
| **Half-life in plasma** | ~33 hours; steady state achieved after ~3–4 weeks of supplementation |

## Dietary Sources

| Food | Serving | CoQ10 Content (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Beef heart | 100 g | 11.3 mg |
| Beef (lean) | 100 g | 3.1 mg |
| Pork | 100 g | 2.4 mg |
| Chicken (leg) | 100 g | 1.6 mg |
| Sardines (tinned) | 100 g | 2.7 mg |
| Salmon (cooked) | 100 g | 0.9 mg |
| Soybean oil | 1 tbsp | 1.0 mg |
| Sesame seeds | 28 g | 0.7 mg |
| Broccoli | 100 g | 0.6 mg |
| Cauliflower | 100 g | 0.6 mg |

> Dietary CoQ10 intake from typical Western diets is ~3–5 mg/day — far below therapeutic supplemental doses. Cooking destroys some CoQ10 (heat-labile). Heart and organ meats are richest sources.

## Clinical Relevance

### Heart Failure
- Cardiac CoQ10 levels are inversely correlated with severity of heart failure (NYHA class)
- **Q-SYMBIO trial** (2014; n=420): CoQ10 300 mg/day for 2 years in heart failure → **43% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)**, reduced all-cause mortality vs placebo — landmark trial, though awaiting replication at scale
- Proposed mechanism: improves mitochondrial ATP production in the energy-starved failing heart, reduces oxidative stress, improves endothelial function

### Statin-Associated Muscle Symptoms (SAMS)
- 5–10% of statin users experience myalgia; severe rhabdomyolysis rare but serious; statin-induced CoQ10 depletion is a proposed (but not confirmed) mechanism
- **RCT evidence is mixed:** Several RCTs failed to show CoQ10 (100–600 mg/day) significantly reduces statin myalgia vs placebo; some positive trials exist; clinical practice varies; supplementation is low-risk and commonly recommended (100–200 mg/day)

### Primary CoQ10 Deficiency
- Rare autosomal recessive deficiency of CoQ10 biosynthesis enzymes (COQ2, COQ4, COQ6, COQ8A/ADCK3 etc.) → mitochondrial disease
- Spectrum: nephropathy, cerebellar ataxia, encephalopathy, exercise intolerance; often CoQ10-responsive (high-dose supplementation: 300–3,000 mg/day)

### Hypertension
- Meta-analyses: CoQ10 (100–225 mg/day) reduces systolic BP by ~11 mmHg and diastolic BP by ~7 mmHg vs placebo — mechanism may involve improved endothelial NO bioavailability and reduced oxidative stress
- Evidence quality is moderate; not a primary antihypertensive treatment but potentially useful as adjunct

### Male Infertility
- Seminal CoQ10 correlates with sperm motility and count; RCTs: CoQ10 300 mg/day for 3–6 months improves sperm motility and morphology in idiopathic male infertility (multiple trials, modest but consistent effect)

### Migraine Prophylaxis
- Several RCTs: CoQ10 300 mg/day reduces migraine frequency (~50% reduction in attack days vs baseline at 3 months) — included in European Headache Federation guidelines as an option for migraine prophylaxis

### Parkinson's Disease
- CoQ10 levels are reduced in substantia nigra mitochondria in PD; Complex I activity is impaired (a site of CoQ10 action)
- Large RCT (QE3 trial; n=600, CoQ10 1,200–2,400 mg/day): **No benefit on PD progression vs placebo** — definitive negative result; CoQ10 not recommended for PD treatment

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Statins** | Deplete plasma and tissue CoQ10 by inhibiting mevalonate pathway; ubiquinol levels fall 16–54%; CoQ10 supplementation may partially compensate |
| **Warfarin** | CoQ10 has structural similarity to menaquinone (Vit K2); may modestly antagonise warfarin (reduce INR) in some patients; monitor INR if adding CoQ10 |
| **Beta-blockers** | Some beta-blockers (propranolol) inhibit CoQ10-dependent enzymes; CoQ10 may partially mitigate beta-blocker-induced fatigue |
| **Dietary fat** | Required for CoQ10 absorption — take with a fat-containing meal; defat/very low-fat diet impairs absorption |
| **Vitamin E** | CoQ10 regenerates vitamin E in membranes; synergistic lipid-soluble antioxidant system; CoQ10 + vitamin E provides broader membrane antioxidant protection than either alone |
| **Alpha-lipoic acid** | ALA regenerates CoQH₂ (ubiquinol); part of the integrated mitochondrial antioxidant network along with GSH |
| **Anticancer drugs (doxorubicin/anthracyclines)** | Anthracyclines cause cardiotoxicity partly via CoQ10 depletion in the heart; CoQ10 co-administration studied as cardioprotective strategy — evidence promising but not yet definitive |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Dose:** 100–300 mg/day for general supplementation; 300–600 mg/day for heart failure, migraines, male infertility; up to 3,000 mg/day for primary CoQ10 deficiency (under medical supervision)
- **Form:** **Ubiquinol** (reduced form) is preferred — better absorbed than ubiquinone, particularly in older adults (>50) who have reduced ability to convert ubiquinone → ubiquinol; soft-gel or oil-based formulations are both superior to crystal powder
- **Timing:** Take with a fat-containing meal; twice-daily dosing produces more stable plasma levels vs once-daily
- **Onset:** Allow 3–4 weeks for plasma steady state; effects on tissue levels (heart, muscle) take longer
- **Safety:** Very well tolerated; rare GI side effects (nausea, diarrhoea) at high doses; no UL established; generally safe long-term; no significant adverse events reported in RCTs at doses up to 3,000 mg/day
- **Drug interactions:** Monitor INR in warfarin users; inform prescriber before adding high-dose CoQ10
