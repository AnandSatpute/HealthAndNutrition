# Beta-Carotene

## Overview
Beta-carotene is the most well-known **provitamin A carotenoid** — upon absorption, it can be cleaved by intestinal beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase (BCMO1) into two molecules of **retinal (vitamin A aldehyde)**, making it the most abundant dietary source of preformed-equivalent vitamin A globally, particularly in plant-based diets. It is an orange-yellow pigment synthesised by plants, algae, and fungi but not by animals; its characteristic colour reflects 9 conjugated double bonds that can absorb blue-violet light (~450 nm). Beyond its provitamin A role, beta-carotene functions as a membrane antioxidant and lipid-soluble free radical scavenger at normal physiological concentrations. However, two landmark clinical trials (ATBC and CARET) found that **high-dose beta-carotene supplementation significantly increased lung cancer risk in smokers** — a sobering example of how a nutrient's safety profile in food differs radically from pharmacological supplementation.

- **Classification:** Carotenoid; provitamin A (most potent dietary provitamin A); symmetric bicyclic carotene
- **Structure:** 40-carbon symmetric carotene; two β-ionone rings connected by a polyene chain; 9 conjugated double bonds (responsible for orange colour)
- **Key property:** **1 molecule β-carotene → theoretical maximum 2 molecules retinal (vitamin A)**; actual yield varies by conversion efficiency, food matrix, individual genetics (BCMO1 polymorphisms)
- **Vitamin A equivalence:** 12 µg dietary β-carotene from food = 1 µg retinol activity equivalent (RAE) [WHO]; 6 µg = 1 RAE for supplements

## Provitamin A Conversion

| Step | Enzyme | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Intestinal cleavage** | BCMO1 (beta-carotene monooxygenase 1; symmetric cleavage) | β-Carotene → 2× retinal (centric cleavage at 15,15' double bond); reaction requires O₂, FAD, Fe²⁺ |
| **Reduction** | Retinal reductase | Retinal → retinol (vitamin A alcohol) in enterocytes |
| **Esterification** | LRAT (lecithin:retinol acyltransferase) | Retinol → retinyl esters → incorporated into chylomicrons |
| **Hepatic storage** | Hepatic stellate cells (Ito cells) | Retinyl esters stored as fat droplets; ~80–90% of body retinol stored in liver |
| **Eccentric cleavage** | BCMO2 (beta-carotene oxygenase 2) | Alternative asymmetric cleavage → β-apo-carotenals (smaller fragments with antioxidant activity) |

**BCMO1 genetic polymorphisms:** ~45% of women are poor converters due to common BCMO1 variants (R267S, A379V) → significantly lower vitamin A yield from plant foods → these individuals depend more on preformed vitamin A (liver, dairy, eggs); a concern for vegans with these polymorphisms.

## Functions

### Provitamin A Activity
- Provides vitamin A for all retinol-dependent functions: rhodopsin synthesis (night vision), retinoic acid signalling (cell differentiation, immune function, embryogenesis), mucosal integrity, immune competence
- In developing countries where preformed vitamin A is scarce (no liver, eggs, or dairy), beta-carotene from orange/yellow fruits and vegetables is the primary vitamin A source

### Antioxidant Activity
- At physiological concentrations (pO₂ <150 mmHg), beta-carotene is an effective singlet oxygen quencher and lipid peroxyl radical chain-breaking antioxidant in cell membranes
- **pO₂-dependent behaviour:** At high partial oxygen pressures (e.g., in lung tissue of smokers with supplemental oxygen or high-dose supplementation), beta-carotene can become a **pro-oxidant** rather than antioxidant — generating peroxyl radicals; this is the mechanistic explanation for the ATBC/CARET findings

### Immune Function (via Vitamin A)
- Vitamin A derived from beta-carotene supports:
  - Mucosal barrier integrity (respiratory, GI)
  - T-cell and B-cell differentiation
  - NK cell and neutrophil function
  - IgA production at mucosal surfaces

## Metabolism and Bioavailability

| Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Food matrix** | Dense chromoplast packaging in carrots and pumpkin significantly reduces bioaccessibility; cooking (particularly with fat) disrupts chromoplasts and increases bioavailability 5–6× |
| **Dietary fat** | Required for micellar solubilisation and absorption; eating cooked carrots with butter/olive oil dramatically increases beta-carotene absorption |
| **Food processing** | Juicing > blending > cooking > raw (for most vegetables); fine particle size aids release from cellular structures |
| **Absorption** | Passive diffusion via SR-BI and CD36; incorporated into chylomicrons as either intact beta-carotene or retinyl esters |
| **Regulatory absorption** | Unlike preformed vitamin A (which can accumulate toxically), beta-carotene absorption decreases at high intake — downregulation of SR-BI and upregulation of BCMO1 limits accumulation (safety mechanism that breaks down with very high-dose supplementation) |
| **Genetic variation (BCMO1)** | Poor converters absorb intact beta-carotene well but convert less to retinol; higher serum beta-carotene but lower vitamin A yield |
| **Intestinal conversion efficiency** | Highly variable: 3–28% of absorbed beta-carotene converted to retinol depending on vitamin A status, genetics, food matrix |

## Dietary Sources

| Food | Serving | Beta-carotene (mg) | RAE (µg) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sweet potato (baked, flesh) | 1 medium (114 g) | 9.4 mg | ~781 µg RAE |
| Carrot (raw) | 1 medium (61 g) | 5.1 mg | ~427 µg RAE |
| Carrot juice | 240 mL | 22 mg | ~1,830 µg RAE |
| Pumpkin (canned) | ½ cup (123 g) | 8.5 mg | ~708 µg RAE |
| Butternut squash (cooked) | 1 cup (205 g) | 9.4 mg | ~781 µg RAE |
| Spinach (cooked) | 1 cup (180 g) | 8.7 mg | ~730 µg RAE |
| Kale (cooked) | 1 cup (130 g) | 5.3 mg | ~440 µg RAE |
| Cantaloupe melon | 1 cup (160 g) | 2.6 mg | ~216 µg RAE |
| Red sweet pepper (raw) | 1 medium (119 g) | 2.1 mg | ~175 µg RAE |
| Apricots (raw) | 3 medium | 1.1 mg | ~92 µg RAE |

> RAE estimates assume 12 µg dietary β-carotene = 1 µg RAE (WHO/IOM), which is conservative; cooked vegetables with fat are approximately twice as efficient (~6 µg = 1 RAE per some guidelines).

## Clinical Relevance

### Vitamin A Deficiency (Global Burden)
- Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) affects ~190 million preschool children and 19 million pregnant women globally, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and South/Southeast Asia
- **Night blindness:** The earliest clinical sign of VAD; reversible with adequate beta-carotene or retinol
- **Xerophthalmia and corneal blindness:** Advanced VAD; irreversible; leading cause of preventable childhood blindness
- **Biofortification:** Golden Rice (transgenic rice expressing β-carotene in the endosperm) and biofortified orange sweet potato are strategies to increase beta-carotene delivery in VAD-endemic regions

### The ATBC and CARET Trials — Landmark Cautionary Findings

> [!CAUTION]
> **ATBC trial (1994):** 29,133 male Finnish smokers; beta-carotene 20 mg/day for 5–8 years → **18% increased lung cancer incidence**, 8% increased overall mortality vs placebo. **CARET trial (1996):** 18,314 smokers/asbestos workers; 30 mg beta-carotene + 25,000 IU retinyl palmitate → **28% increased lung cancer incidence**, 17% increased overall mortality → trial stopped early. Neither supplement group showed benefit in any subgroup.

- **Mechanism (proposed):** In the oxidant-rich lung environment of smokers, pharmacological beta-carotene generates reactive beta-carotene radicals → propagate lipid peroxidation → carcinogenic arachidonic acid derivatives; also interferes with RA (retinoic acid) signalling → loss of tumour suppression
- **Key lesson:** Food-form beta-carotene is safe (associated with lower cancer risk in observational studies); isolated high-dose supplement beta-carotene is harmful in smokers and possibly in heavy exercisers (similar mechanism)

### Beta-Carotene vs. Lutein/Zeaxanthin in AMD
- AREDS1 formula contained 15 mg beta-carotene; AREDS2 replaced it with 10 mg lutein + 2 mg zeaxanthin: non-inferior for AMD protection, superior in smokers (beta-carotene concerns), and no competitive absorption issues for macular carotenoids

### Carotenodermia (Hypercarotenaemia)
- Harmless orange-yellow discolouration of the skin (palms, soles, nasolabial folds) from very high dietary beta-carotene intake (>30 mg beta-carotene/day from food, e.g., carrot juice drinkers); reversible on reducing intake; **does not cause hypervitaminosis A** (unlike retinol supplementation)

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Vitamin A (retinol) status** | When vitamin A stores are replete, BCMO1 activity decreases → less beta-carotene converted → more passes as intact carotenoid; when deficient, conversion upregulated |
| **Dietary fat** | Required for absorption; critical importance to consume with fat-containing foods |
| **Lutein and zeaxanthin** | Compete for intestinal absorption via shared SR-BI transporter; high-dose beta-carotene supplements reduce plasma lutein/zeaxanthin levels |
| **Iron and zinc** | Deficiencies impair beta-carotene conversion to retinol (iron: required by BCMO1; zinc: required for retinol mobilisation from liver via RBP) |
| **Vitamin E** | Both are fat-soluble antioxidants in membranes; synergistic antioxidant protection at physiological concentrations |
| **Alcohol** | Impairs retinol mobilisation from liver; combined with beta-carotene supplements, alcohol increases hepatotoxicity risk |
| **Orlistat (fat absorption blocker)** | Significantly reduces absorption of all fat-soluble nutrients including beta-carotene; patients on orlistat need vitamin A monitoring |
| **Smoking** | In smokers, beta-carotene supplementation is contraindicated; dietary beta-carotene from food remains safe; smoking directly depletes plasma carotenoids |

## Supplementation Notes
- **From food: safe and beneficial** — high dietary beta-carotene from fruits and vegetables is consistently associated with lower cancer and CVD risk in epidemiological studies
- **Supplemental beta-carotene:**
  - **Contraindicated in smokers and asbestos-exposed individuals** (ATBC/CARET evidence)
  - **Not recommended** as an isolated supplement for general population (WCRF, WHO, ACS)
  - Still present in some multivitamins — smokers should choose vitamin A as retinyl palmitate instead
- **For vitamin A supplementation:** Preformed retinyl palmitate (IU-dosed) is safer and more reliable than beta-carotene for people with BCMO1 polymorphisms, malabsorption, or significant VAD
- **Natural mixed carotenoids** (from algae: Dunaliella salina — contains alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin together): may be safer than pure synthetic beta-carotene due to the antioxidant buffering of the other carotenoids; not definitively proven
- **Note for vegans:** Those following strict vegan diets should assess beta-carotene intake and, if BCMO1 poor-converter status is suspected (genetic testing available), consider preformed vitamin A from supplements or fortified foods
