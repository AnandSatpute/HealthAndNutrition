# Zeaxanthin

## Overview
Zeaxanthin is a **xanthophyll carotenoid** that is the direct stereoisomer of lutein, differing only in the position of a double bond in one of its end-rings. Like lutein, zeaxanthin has **no provitamin A activity** and is classified as a non-essential nutrient. It is the dominant carotenoid of the **fovea centralis** — the centre of the macula responsible for high-acuity central vision — while lutein predominates in the peripheral macula. Together, lutein and zeaxanthin compose the **macular pigment** (MPOD), which serves as a blue-light filter and antioxidant shield for the photoreceptors. A third macular carotenoid, **meso-zeaxanthin**, is derived in situ from retinal lutein by the RPE and is not typically found in food — it is concentrated at the very centre of the fovea. Zeaxanthin is found in highest concentrations in orange/yellow peppers, maize, and egg yolks.

- **Classification:** Xanthophyll carotenoid (dihydroxy); fat-soluble; no provitamin A activity; stereoisomer of lutein
- **Structure:** 40-carbon symmetric carotenoid with –OH groups on both ε-rings; fully symmetric (unlike asymmetric lutein); 11 conjugated double bonds
- **Key distinction from lutein:** Zeaxanthin concentrates in the *central* fovea centralis; lutein in the *peripheral* macula; zeaxanthin is the higher singlet oxygen quencher per molecule (fully symmetric conjugation)
- **Meso-zeaxanthin:** The (3R,3'S) stereoisomer of zeaxanthin; not in food; made in the fovea from retinal lutein → highest antioxidant capacity at the centre of vision

## Functions

- **Blue light filtering (fovea):** Zeaxanthin is at highest density in the very centre of the fovea — where visual acuity is sharpest and phototoxic risk is greatest (focused light beam converges here); absorbs 400–500 nm blue-violet light before it reaches the photoreceptors
- **Superior singlet oxygen quenching:** Zeaxanthin has a higher ¹O₂ quenching rate constant than lutein (due to its fully symmetric conjugated system) — most effective carotenoid antioxidant at the foveal centre
- **Photoreceptor membrane protection:** The outer segments of cone photoreceptors in the fovea contain very high concentrations of DHA (70–80% of fatty acids), making them exquisitely vulnerable to lipid peroxidation; zeaxanthin quenches peroxyl radicals in these membranes
- **Visual processing and contrast sensitivity:** Higher MPOD (reflecting higher zeaxanthin+lutein) is associated with better photostress recovery, glare tolerance, and contrast sensitivity — particularly relevant under high-glare conditions (driving, digital screens)
- **Brain:** Present in brain tissue (similar to lutein); associated with cognitive performance; less well-studied than lutein in neurological contexts
- **Retinal ganglion cell protection:** In vitro and animal models: zeaxanthin protects retinal ganglion cells (damaged in glaucoma) from oxidative stress

## Metabolism and Bioavailability

| Factor | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Same pathway as lutein: micellar solubilisation → SR-BI/CD36 uptake in enterocytes → chylomicrons → lymph → plasma |
| **Dietary fat** | Required; take zeaxanthin-rich foods or supplements with fat |
| **Egg yolk bioavailability** | Egg yolk zeaxanthin (free form, in lipid droplets) is significantly more bioavailable than zeaxanthin in peppers (protein/fibre bound); proportion of zeaxanthin in egg yolk lutein+zeaxanthin: ~15–30% (more lutein than zeaxanthin in eggs) |
| **Plasma transport** | Primarily in HDL (like lutein); transferred to various tissues including macula |
| **Retinal accumulation** | GSTP1 (at macula periphery) binds lutein; GSTP1-related protein at the foveal centre may concentrate zeaxanthin; meso-zeaxanthin derived from lutein by RPE isomerase activity |
| **MPOD measurement** | Measures combined lutein + zeaxanthin (including meso-zeaxanthin) at the macula; normal MPOD ~0.3–0.5 OD; AMD patients typically have low MPOD |
| **Supplementation response** | MPOD increases over 3–12 months with supplementation; meso-zeaxanthin supplements specifically raise central foveal carotenoid density |

## Dietary Sources

| Food | Serving | Zeaxanthin (mg) | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orange sweet pepper | 1 medium (119 g) | 5.1 mg | Richest food source of zeaxanthin |
| Yellow sweet pepper | 1 medium | 1.3 mg | |
| Corn / maize (cooked) | 1 cup (154 g) | 0.9 mg | Both lutein + zeaxanthin |
| Egg yolk | 1 large | ~0.05–0.2 mg | High bioavailability; ratio of zeaxanthin in egg varies by hen feed |
| Orange (mandarin) | 1 medium | 0.15 mg | |
| Goji berries (wolfberries) | 28 g | 1.0–3.6 mg | Rich source of zeaxanthin specifically |
| Saffron | 1 g (culinary dose) | 2–12 mg (as zeaxanthin esters) | Highest zeaxanthin concentration of any food by weight |
| Kale, spinach | See lutein table | Predominantly lutein (~6:1 ratio) | |

> **Goji berries** (*Lycium barbarum*) are uniquely rich in zeaxanthin dipalmitate (zeaxanthin ester) — a major traditional food in Chinese medicine with claimed vision benefits; human trials support MPOD improvement with goji supplementation.

## Clinical Relevance

### Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
- Zeaxanthin is the co-active carotenoid in the AREDS2 formulation alongside lutein (10 mg lutein + **2 mg zeaxanthin** daily)
- Zeaxanthin at the fovea is specifically protective of central vision — the type of vision most critical for reading and face recognition (lost in advanced AMD)
- **CREST trial** and **MOST study:** Supplementation including meso-zeaxanthin (10 mg) + lutein + zeaxanthin showed greater MPOD improvement and functional vision gains (contrast sensitivity, reading speed) than lutein+zeaxanthin without meso-zeaxanthin

### Glaucoma (Emerging Evidence)
- Zeaxanthin may protect retinal ganglion cells (the cell type damaged in glaucoma); animal models consistently show benefit; human RCTs sparse; early signal in the literature

### Diabetic Retinopathy
- Diabetic retinopathy involves significant oxidative stress and neovascularisation in the retina; low plasma zeaxanthin is associated with higher DR severity in T2DM patients; intervention trials limited

### Cognitive Function
- Zeaxanthin is present in brain tissue; higher plasma zeaxanthin associated with better verbal fluency and memory in older adults (Observational studies); limited interventional data for zeaxanthin specifically vs. lutein

### Saffron and Macular Health
- Saffron (*Crocus sativus*) supplementation (20–30 mg/day of saffron extract ≈ 1.5–3 mg zeaxanthin equivalents) was studied in AMD — Italian RCT (Falsini et al.): 20 mg/day saffron for 3 months improved retinal function (ERG) vs placebo in early AMD; mechanism attributed to crocin/zeaxanthin content; very small trial, needs replication

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Lutein** | Synergistic macular partner; lutein and zeaxanthin are always measured together (MPOD); supplements should contain both; AREDS2 ratio: 5:1 (lutein:zeaxanthin); CREST added meso-zeaxanthin |
| **Meso-zeaxanthin** | The third macular carotenoid; derived from lutein in the fovea; supplements including all three provide more complete foveal coverage; meso-zeaxanthin not obtainable from common foods |
| **Omega-3 DHA** | Synergistic with zeaxanthin in protecting the DHA-rich photoreceptor outer segments; DHA + zeaxanthin combined supplementation studied in AMD with additive effects |
| **Beta-carotene** | Competes for intestinal absorption; high-dose beta-carotene may reduce zeaxanthin absorption; AREDS2 deliberately replaced beta-carotene with lutein+zeaxanthin |
| **Dietary fat** | Required for absorption; low-fat meals significantly reduce zeaxanthin bioavailability |
| **Smoking** | Significantly depletes plasma and macular carotenoids; smoking is the strongest modifiable AMD risk factor; smokers especially benefit from lutein+zeaxanthin intake |

## Supplementation Notes
- **AMD prevention/treatment (AREDS2 standard):** 10 mg lutein + **2 mg zeaxanthin** per day; use with AREDS2 full vitamin/mineral formula for intermediate AMD
- **Enhanced MPOD formula:** 10 mg lutein + 2 mg zeaxanthin + **10 mg meso-zeaxanthin** (e.g., MacuShield Gold formula) — additional improvement in central foveal MPOD vs standard AREDS2; particularly relevant for patients with low MPOD in central fovea
- **General vision/blue light health:** 6 mg zeaxanthin/day + 10–20 mg lutein supports MPOD; beneficial for high-screen-time users, pilots, and athletes requiring acute visual performance
- **Goji berry extract:** Contains zeaxanthin dipalmitate esters; 15 g/day dried goji or standardised extract shown to increase plasma zeaxanthin and MPOD
- **Safety:** No UL; no toxicity; no provitamin A activity; safe in smokers; well tolerated at all studied doses
- **Saffron:** Culinary use (~0.5–1 g/day in cooking) is safe; supplemental saffron (15–20 mg/day standardised extract) being studied in AMD — promising but not yet standard of care
