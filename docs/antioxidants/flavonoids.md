# Flavonoids

## Overview
Flavonoids are the largest and most studied subclass of polyphenols, with over **6,000 individual compounds** identified in the plant kingdom. They share a common **C6-C3-C6 backbone** (two aromatic rings connected by a 3-carbon bridge forming a central pyranone ring), with structural variations in oxidation state, hydroxylation pattern, and glycosylation giving rise to six major subclasses. Flavonoids are responsible for the brilliant reds, blues, purples, and yellows of fruits and flowers, and serve plants as UV protectants, antimicrobials, and pollinator attractors. In human nutrition, flavonoids are among the most bioactive dietary components — with consistent epidemiological associations and a growing body of RCT evidence linking flavonoid intake to cardiovascular protection, metabolic health, cognitive preservation, and cancer prevention. The highest flavonoid intakes are associated with ~20–40% lower risk of CVD mortality across multiple large prospective cohort studies.

- **Classification:** Subclass of polyphenols; 6 major subclasses; C6-C3-C6 basic structure
- **Key characteristic:** Most naturally occur as **glycosides** (bound to sugars — primarily glucose, rhamnose, rutinose); hydrolysed in the gut to **aglycones** (free flavonoid) before/after absorption
- **Bioavailability:** Highly variable across subclasses and food matrices; gut microbiome is a critical determinant of metabolism and bioactivity
- **Most studied subclass:** Flavan-3-ols (catechins/epicatechins — in cocoa, green tea, apples) for cardiovascular effects; Flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol) for broad anti-inflammatory effects; Anthocyanins (berries) for neuroprotection and vascular health; Isoflavones (soy) for endocrine effects

## The Six Subclasses

### 1. Flavan-3-ols (Catechins)

| Compound | Source | Key Properties |
|---|---|---|
| Epicatechin (EC) | Cocoa, apples, grapes, green tea | Most studied; potent eNOS activator → NO production → vasodilation; anti-platelet |
| Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) | Green tea (50–80% of green tea catechins) | Strongest antioxidant among catechins; inhibits COX-2, NF-κB, mTOR, VEGF-R; anti-proliferative; hepatotoxic at high supplemental doses |
| Theaflavins | Black tea (formed from catechin oxidation) | LDL-C lowering; anti-inflammatory |
| Proanthocyanidins (OPCs) | Grape seed, cranberry, cacao | Oligomers of catechins; strong antioxidants, anti-adhesion properties |

**Clinical evidence (flavan-3-ols):**
- Cocoa epicatechin: COSMOS-Heart RCT (n=21,442, 3.6 years, 500 mg/day cocoa extract → 27% reduction in CVD deaths — one of the most significant dietary supplement RCTs)
- Dose-response meta-analysis: 200 mg/day flavan-3-ols → −4 mmHg systolic BP; strong endothelial function improvement (FMD)
- Green tea EGCG (600 mg/day catechins): Italian prostate cancer RCT — 30% reduction in prostate cancer incidence in high-risk men over 1 year

### 2. Flavonols

| Compound | Source | Intake (typical Western diet) |
|---|---|---|
| **Quercetin** | Onions (highest), capers, kale, apples, berries | ~25–50 mg/day |
| **Kaempferol** | Kale, endive, leek, broccoli, spinach | ~10–20 mg/day |
| **Myricetin** | Berries, red wine, walnuts | ~1–2 mg/day |
| **Fisetin** | Strawberries, apples, onions, cucumbers | Trace |

**Quercetin — most studied flavonol:**
- Mechanism: NF-κB inhibition, Nrf2 activation, AMPK activation, PI3K/mTOR inhibition, COX-2 inhibition, COMT inhibition (catecholamine metabolism)
- **Anti-inflammatory:** Multiple RCTs confirm reduced CRP, IL-6, TNF-α with quercetin supplementation (500–1,000 mg/day)
- **Blood pressure:** Meta-analysis (n>1,000): 153 mg/day quercetin → −2.6/−2.2 mmHg sys/dia BP reduction
- **Antihistamine / anti-allergy:** Inhibits mast cell degranulation; clinical trial: quercetin equivalent to cromolyn sodium for pollen allergy symptom scores
- **Fisetin — senolytic activity:** Emerging use as a "senolytic" (clears senescent cells); Mayo Clinic RCT: intermittent high-dose fisetin (20 mg/kg × 2 days/month) significantly reduced senescent cell burden markers in elderly; pipeline of senolytic trials ongoing

### 3. Flavones

| Compound | Source | Key Properties |
|---|---|---|
| **Apigenin** | Parsley (richest), chamomile, celery, artichoke | Anxiolytic (GABA-A receptor partial agonist); anti-inflammatory; NF-κB inhibition; mild sedative (chamomile tea mechanism) |
| **Luteolin** | Celery, thyme, green pepper, broccoli | Anti-inflammatory (potent COX-2 inhibitor); neuroprotective; anti-proliferative in cancer cell lines |
| **Nobiletin, Tangeretin** | Citrus peel | Metabolic syndrome; anti-inflammatory; cognitive effects in animal models |
| **Baicalein** | Chinese skullcap (*Scutellaria baicalensis*) | Anti-viral, anti-inflammatory; studied for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition |

### 4. Flavanones

| Compound | Source | Key Properties |
|---|---|---|
| **Hesperidin** | Orange, lemon peel | Venous tone; capillary permeability; leg oedema; mild LDL-C reduction; **diosmin+hesperidin (Daflon)**: approved in many countries for chronic venous insufficiency and haemorrhoids |
| **Naringenin / Naringin** | Grapefruit, orange | **CYP3A4 inhibitor** — the "grapefruit effect" is primarily from naringenin + furanocoumarins; anti-inflammatory; improves insulin sensitivity |
| **Eriodictyol** | Lemons, other citrus | Anti-inflammatory; antioxidant |

> **Grapefruit drug interaction:** Furanocoumarins (and to a lesser extent naringenin) in grapefruit irreversibly inhibit intestinal CYP3A4 for 12–24 hours → dramatically increases bioavailability of CYP3A4-metabolised drugs (contraindicated drugs: statins, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, some calcium channel blockers, certain benzodiazepines, many others). One glass of grapefruit juice can produce the same effect as multiple glasses over a day (enzyme recovery takes 24 h). A formal drug interaction check is mandatory when patients consume grapefruit.

### 5. Anthocyanins

| Compound | Source | Key Properties |
|---|---|---|
| **Cyanidin** | Cherries, blackcurrants, elderberry, red cabbage | eNOS activation; anti-inflammatory; neuroprotective |
| **Delphinidin** | Blueberries, purple corn, bilberry | VEGF inhibition; anti-angiogenic; retinal protection |
| **Pelargonidin** | Strawberries | Antioxidant; bioavailable |
| **Malvidin** | Red wine, blueberries, bilberry | Cardiovascular; eNOS; contributes to red wine anthocyanin activity |
| **Peonidin** | Blueberries, cherries | Neuroprotective in animal models |
| **Petunidin** | Blueberries | Anticancer models |

**Anthocyanins — standout clinical evidence:**
- **Blood pressure and vascular function:** Meta-analysis (25 RCTs, n>1,500): anthocyanin supplementation → −3.72 mmHg systolic, −3.33 mmHg diastolic BP vs placebo
- **Cognitive function:** BLUEBERRY RCT (University of Cincinnati): 24 weeks of wild blueberry supplementation significantly improved verbal memory in mild cognitive impairment (MCI); mechanism: eNOS-mediated cerebrovascular blood flow improvement
- **Tart cherry (cyanidin-3-glucoside):** Multiple RCTs → reduces muscle soreness post-exercise, reduces uric acid (gout prevention), improves sleep (natural melatonin + anti-inflammatory)
- **Bilberry (delphinidin-predominant):** Retinal blood flow and visual acuity in fatigue; historical WWII RAF pilots use (folklore supported by limited trial data)
- **Elderberry (Sambucus nigra):** Meta-analysis: standardised elderberry extract reduced duration of cold/flu by ~2–4 days; inhibits viral neuraminidase and haemagglutinin; cytokine-stimulating effects (caution in cytokine storm conditions)

### 6. Isoflavones

| Compound | Source | Key Properties |
|---|---|---|
| **Genistein** | Soy (primary); chickpeas, fava beans | Phytoestrogen (ERβ agonist/ERα weak); topoisomerase II inhibitor; angiogenesis inhibition |
| **Daidzein → Equol** | Soy → gut bacteria (only ~30% of Westerners produce equol) | Equol has stronger estrogenic activity than daidzein; equol producers have better menopausal symptom response to soy |
| **Formononetin → Daidzein** | Red clover → gut | Red clover isoflavones used for menopausal hot flushes; less evidence than estrogen therapy |
| **Biochanin A → Genistein** | Red clover, peanuts → gut | Anti-proliferative |

**Isoflavones — clinical context:**
- **Menopausal symptoms:** Soy isoflavones (75–150 mg/day) modestly reduce hot flush frequency (~15–20% reduction vs placebo), inferior to hormone therapy but safe option for those who cannot use HRT; effect dependent on equol-producer status
- **Bone health:** Post-menopausal RCTs: isoflavones (>54 mg/day for >12 weeks) significantly reduce bone loss vs placebo in multiple meta-analyses
- **Breast cancer concern:** No evidence soy isoflavones at food doses increase breast cancer risk in women; observational data from Asian cohorts suggests inverse association (early soy exposure may be protective); isoflavone supplementation in breast cancer survivors is not contraindicated by current evidence, but discuss with oncologist
- **Thyroid:** May impair thyroid peroxidase activity at high doses; separate levothyroxine by ≥4 hours from soy intake

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Non-haem iron absorption** | Quercetin, EGCG, hesperidin chelate Fe²⁺ and inhibit iron absorption; separate flavonoid-rich beverages (tea, coffee) from iron-rich meals by ≥1 hour for iron-deficient individuals |
| **Drug metabolism (CYP450)** | Grapefruit flavanones (naringenin + furanocoumarins): irreversible CYP3A4 inhibitor; EGCG: inhibits CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein; quercetin: inhibits CYP2C9 (warfarin metabolism) — warfarin INR monitoring |
| **Thyroid medications** | Soy isoflavones + levothyroxine: separate by ≥4 hours; may impair absorption |
| **Anticoagulants** | Multiple flavonoids have anti-platelet effects; potentiate warfarin/aspirin; monitor INR |
| **Gut microbiome** | Flavonoid effects are extensively modulated by gut bacteria; equol production from daidzein requires specific bacterial strains; lack of these strains reduces soy isoflavone efficacy |
| **Dietary fat** | Not strongly required for flavonoid absorption (unlike carotenoids) — most flavonoids are hydrophilic glycosides; but mild fat co-ingestion improves some aglycone absorption |
| **Zinc** | High doses of quercetin may chelate zinc; relevant only at supplemental doses |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Quercetin (500–1,000 mg/day):** Most widely used flavonoid supplement; anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anti-allergy; generally well tolerated; headache and tingling at high doses; combine with bromelain or vitamin C for enhanced absorption; quercetin phytosome (QP) has significantly better bioavailability
- **EGCG/Green tea extract (400–800 mg/day EGCG):** Weight management (modest, −1.2 kg in meta-analysis), antioxidant; **hepatotoxicity risk >800 mg/day EGCG on empty stomach** — FDA safety warning; always take with food; decaffeinated extract available for caffeine-sensitive individuals
- **Anthocyanin/berry extracts:** Elderberry, bilberry, tart cherry, blueberry extracts — 250–1,000 mg/day; cardiovascular, cognitive, exercise recovery benefits; generally very safe
- **Cocoa flavanols (700 mg/day standardised):** Best RCT evidence for cardiovascular endpoints; prefer products standardised to epicatechin; flavanol content in chocolate varies widely with processing (dark chocolate ≠ high-flavanol; look for standardised extracts)
- **Isoflavones (75–150 mg/day):** Menopausal symptom management, bone health in post-menopausal women; Red clover isoflavones (Promensil — 40–80 mg/day isoflavones) have the most RCT data for hot flushes
- **Fisetin (100–500 mg/day; intermittent high-dose protocols being studied):** Emerging senolytic; most antioxidant flavonoid (ORAC); very low oral bioavailability — nanoparticle/liposomal formulations in development
- **Hesperidin/Diosmin (Daflon 500 mg twice daily):** Clinically approved in many countries for chronic venous insufficiency and haemorrhoids; well tolerated; one of the most evidence-based flavonoid applications
