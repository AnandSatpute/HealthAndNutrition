# Acetylcholine (ACh)

## Overview

Acetylcholine is a quaternary ammonium neurotransmitter synthesised from **choline and acetyl-CoA**. It is the predominant neurotransmitter at the **neuromuscular junction** (voluntary muscle control), in the **autonomic nervous system** (all parasympathetic, all preganglionic sympathetic), and in multiple CNS circuits governing **attention, memory encoding, and REM sleep**. The cholinergic system is one of the first to degenerate in Alzheimer's disease.

> **Key insight** — Unlike most neurotransmitters, the rate-limiting factor for ACh synthesis is typically **choline availability**, not the enzyme. Choline must come from diet or phosphatidylcholine breakdown; de novo synthesis in the liver is inadequate for high neuronal demand.

## Synthesis Pathway

```
Dietary Choline / Phosphatidylcholine (PC)
      │
      │ PC hydrolysis by phospholipase D → Choline released
      │ Choline actively transported into presynaptic terminal via CHT1
      │ (Na⁺-dependent high-affinity choline transporter)
      │
      │ [Choline Acetyltransferase — ChAT]
      │  + Acetyl-CoA (from mitochondria / pyruvate → PDH complex)
      │  Cofactor: CoA (Pantothenate / Vitamin B5-derived)
      │  ⚠ Choline availability is rate-limiting in most contexts
      ▼
Acetylcholine (ACh)
      │
      │ Loaded into synaptic vesicles by VAChT (vesicular ACh transporter)
      ▼
Stored → Released by exocytosis
```

### Step-by-Step Cofactor Requirements

| Step | Enzyme / Transporter | Required Cofactors / Nutrients |
|---|---|---|
| **Choline uptake** | CHT1 | Na⁺ gradient (ATP-dependent); adequate **plasma choline** |
| **Pyruvate → Acetyl-CoA** | PDH complex | **Thiamine (B1)**, **Riboflavin (B2)**, **Niacin (B3)**, **Lipoic acid**, **Pantothenate (B5)**, Mg²⁺ |
| **Choline + Acetyl-CoA → ACh** ⚠ | ChAT | No vitamin cofactor per se — rate determined by **choline** and **acetyl-CoA** availability |
| **Vesicular loading** | VAChT | Mg²⁺, ATP (proton gradient) |

## Acetyl-CoA: The Cholinergic Bottleneck Under Energy Stress

Acetyl-CoA is produced primarily from:
- Pyruvate (via PDH — requires B1, B2, B3, B5, lipoic acid)
- β-oxidation of fatty acids
- Ketone body metabolism (acetoacetate → acetyl-CoA)

**In hypoglycaemia or mitochondrial dysfunction**, acetyl-CoA availability drops → ACh synthesis falls → cognitive impairment precedes energy-related symptoms.

## Degradation Pathway

Acetylcholine degradation is **entirely enzymatic** (no reuptake of intact ACh):

```
Acetylcholine (synaptic cleft)
      │
      │ [Acetylcholinesterase — AChE]
      │  Location: synaptic cleft (membrane-anchored), red blood cells
      │  This is one of the fastest enzymes in the body (~25,000 ACh/sec)
      │  No cofactor required (serine esterase — uses catalytic triad)
      ▼
Choline  +  Acetate
      │
      │ Choline recycled via CHT1 → re-used for synthesis
      │ Acetate → converted to Acetyl-CoA in mitochondria
```

**Pseudocholinesterase (BuChE):**
- In plasma, liver, and glial cells
- Broader substrate specificity (also hydrolyses drugs like succinylcholine, cocaine)
- Not essential for ACh signalling but provides backup at NMJ when AChE is impaired

## Choline Sources (Dietary & Endogenous)

| Source | Choline Content |
|---|---|
| Beef liver (85g) | ~356 mg |
| Eggs (1 large, hard boiled) | ~147 mg |
| Salmon (85g cooked) | ~187 mg |
| Chicken breast (85g cooked) | ~72 mg |
| Soybeans (cooked, 180g) | ~214 mg |
| Brussels sprouts (80g cooked) | ~32 mg |
| **AI (Adequate Intake)** | Men: 550 mg/day; Women: 425 mg/day; Pregnancy: 450 mg/day |

**Endogenous PEMT pathway:**
- Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) → Phosphatidylcholine (PC) via PEMT enzyme
- Requires: **3 SAM molecules** (high methylation demand — needs B12, folate, B2, Mg²⁺)
- Accounts for ~15–25% of hepatic choline; insufficient for total body needs

## Cofactors and Nutritional Support — Summary

| Nutrient | Role | Effect of Deficiency |
|---|---|---|
| **Choline** | Immediate ACh precursor; rate-limiting | Low ACh synthesis; memory impairment; fatty liver |
| **Pantothenate (B5)** | CoA synthesis → Acetyl-CoA | Reduced ACh synthesis capacity |

| **Niacin (B3)** | NAD⁺ for PDH complex | Energy and ACh synthesis impaired |
| **Lipoic acid** | PDH complex cofactor | Impairs Acetyl-CoA production |
| **Folate (5-MTHF) + B12** | PEMT pathway (SAM) for choline synthesis | Reduced endogenous choline |
| **Magnesium** | VAChT vesicular loading | Impaired vesicular storage and release |

## Clinical Relevance

| Condition | ACh Status | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Alzheimer's disease** | Severe cholinergic deficit | Loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (nucleus basalis of Meynert) |
| **Myasthenia gravis** | ACh normal; receptors blocked | Autoantibodies against nAChR → NMJ transmission failure |
| **Lambert-Eaton syndrome** | Reduced ACh release | Autoantibodies against presynaptic Ca²⁺ channels → impaired exocytosis |
| **Organophosphate poisoning** | ACh excess (AChE blocked) | AChE irreversibly inhibited → SLUDGE (Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defaecation, GI cramping, Emesis) + bradycardia |
| **Soman/Sarin (nerve agents)** | AChE irreversibly inhibited | Convulsions; death |
| **Dry mouth / cognitive fog** | Low ACh (drug-induced) | Anticholinergic drugs (promethazine, diphenhydramine, oxybutynin) — cumulative ACh burden |
