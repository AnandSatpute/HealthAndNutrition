# Neurotransmitters — Overview

## What Are Neurotransmitters?

Neurotransmitters are endogenous chemical messengers synthesised and released by neurons (and some glial cells) to transmit signals across synapses to target cells. They govern virtually every physiological and psychological function: mood, cognition, sleep, appetite, pain, motor control, and autonomic regulation.

> **Key insight** — Most neurotransmitters are derived from common dietary amino acids. Their synthesis, release, and degradation are tightly regulated by enzymes that critically depend on vitamins, minerals, and cofactors. Nutritional status directly sets the ceiling for neurotransmitter output.

## Classification of Neurotransmitters

| Class | Examples | Primary Precursor |
|---|---|---|
| **Monoamines — Catecholamines** | Dopamine, Norepinephrine, Epinephrine | L-Tyrosine |
| **Monoamines — Indolamines** | Serotonin, Melatonin | L-Tryptophan |
| **Monoamines — Imidazolamines** | Histamine | L-Histidine |
| **Amino Acids (inhibitory)** | GABA, Glycine | Glutamate, Serine |
| **Amino Acids (excitatory)** | Glutamate, Aspartate | Glutamine, α-ketoglutarate |
| **Cholinergic** | Acetylcholine | Choline + Acetyl-CoA |
| **Opioid Peptides** | Endorphins, Enkephalins, Dynorphins | POMC, Proenkephalin |
| **Neuropeptides** | Substance P, NPY, CRH, Oxytocin | Varied protein precursors |
| **Gaseous** | Nitric Oxide (NO), CO, H₂S | Arginine, Haem, Cysteine |

## The Synthesis–Release–Degradation Cycle

All neurotransmitters share a common functional lifecycle:

```
Dietary Precursor (amino acid / choline / etc.)
        │
        ▼ [Rate-limiting synthesis step — enzyme + cofactors]
Neurotransmitter (stored in vesicles)
        │
        ▼ [Action potential → vesicle fusion → exocytosis]
Synapse (binds post-synaptic receptors)
        │
        ├─► Reuptake (transporter proteins — SERT, DAT, NET, GAT)
        │          → recycled or degraded in presynaptic terminal
        │
        └─► Enzymatic Degradation
                   → MAO-A, MAO-B, COMT, AChE, GABA-T
                   → inactive metabolites → urine / faeces
```

### Rate-Limiting Enzymes

| Neurotransmitter | Rate-Limiting Enzyme | Key Cofactors |
|---|---|---|
| Serotonin | Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH1/2) | Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), Fe²⁺, O₂ |
| Dopamine | Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) | BH4, Fe²⁺, O₂ |
| Norepinephrine | Dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) | Vitamin C, Cu²⁺, O₂ |
| GABA | Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) | Pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP / B6) |
| Acetylcholine | Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) | Acetyl-CoA (B5/pantothenate chain) |
| Histamine | Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) | Pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP / B6) |
| Melatonin | Acetylserotonin methyltransferase (ASMT) | SAM (methylation — requires B12, folate, B2) |

## Shared Cofactors and Nutrient Dependencies

| Nutrient | Role in Neurotransmitter Metabolism |
|---|---|
| **Vitamin B6 (PLP)** | Essential cofactor for DOPA decarboxylase (serotonin, dopamine, GABA, histamine synthesis) |
| **Vitamin B9 (Folate / 5-MTHF)** | Regenerates BH4; provides methyl groups for catecholamine methylation via SAM |
| **Vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin)** | SAM regeneration; methionine synthase; myelin maintenance |
| **Vitamin B3 (Niacin)** | Tryptophan competes with NAD⁺ synthesis — deficiency diverts tryptophan away from serotonin |
| **Vitamin B5 (Pantothenate)** | Acetyl-CoA synthesis for acetylcholine production |
| **Vitamin C (Ascorbate)** | DBH cofactor (norepinephrine synthesis); antioxidant protection of BH4 |
| **Vitamin D** | Regulates tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase gene expression |
| **Iron (Fe²⁺)** | TH and TPH enzyme cofactor; also required for BH4 recycling |
| **Zinc** | Co-factor for DOPA decarboxylase; modulates NMDA receptor; required for MAO activity |
| **Magnesium** | NMDA receptor blocker (prevents excitotoxicity); cofactor for many kinases in signalling |
| **Copper (Cu²⁺)** | DBH cofactor (dopamine → norepinephrine) |
| **Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)** | Essential cofactor for TH (dopamine) and TPH (serotonin); regenerated by folate/B12 |
| **SAM (S-adenosylmethionine)** | Methyl donor for COMT (catecholamine inactivation), HNMT (histamine), ASMT (melatonin) |
| **Omega-3 fatty acids (DHA)** | Modulate receptor density (5-HT, D2, NMDA); membrane fluidity for synaptic vesicle release |
