# Endorphins & Enkephalins (Endogenous Opioid Peptides)

## Overview

Endogenous opioid peptides are neuropeptides that mimic the effects of opioid drugs by binding to opioid receptors (μ, κ, δ). They modulate **pain, reward, stress responses, thermoregulation, immune function, and mood**. Unlike small-molecule neurotransmitters, they are synthesised as large **precursor proteins** that are enzymatically cleaved into active fragments.

| Peptide Family | Precursor | Key Active Peptides | Primary Receptor |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Endorphins** | POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin) | β-Endorphin, α-endorphin, γ-endorphin | μ (mu) > δ |
| **Enkephalins** | Proenkephalin A | Met-enkephalin, Leu-enkephalin | δ (delta) > μ |
| **Dynorphins** | Prodynorphin | Dynorphin A, Dynorphin B, α-neoendorphin | κ (kappa) |
| **Endomorphins** | Unknown precursor | Endomorphin-1, Endomorphin-2 | μ (high selectivity) |
| **Nociceptin (OFQ)** | Pronociceptin | Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ | NOP (opioid-related) |

> **Key insight** — Endorphins and enkephalins are not stored awaiting release like dopamine or serotonin. They are synthesised **on demand** by gene expression and precursor protein processing. This makes them highly dependent on adequate nutritional co-factors for transcription, translation, and post-translational processing.

## Synthesis Pathway: β-Endorphin (POMC Pathway)

```
Dietary Amino Acids (protein → translation)
      │
      │ [POMC gene transcription → mRNA]
      │  Regulated by: CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone), IL-6, insulin, dopamine
      │  Co-activators: zinc-finger transcription factors — require Zn²⁺
      ▼
POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin) — 267 amino acids
      │
      │ [PC1 (Proprotein convertase 1/3)]
      │  Requires: Ca²⁺; zinc metalloprotease activity; Vitamin C (for some PCs)
      │  Cut sites: dibasic residues (Arg-Lys / Lys-Arg pairs)
      ▼
β-Lipotropin (β-LPH)  +  ACTH
      │
      │ [PC2]  Requires: Ca²⁺, alkaline pH (secretory vesicle)
      ▼
β-Endorphin (31 amino acids)  ←── major analgesic opioid
γ-MSH / α-MSH / CLIP (ACTH fragments)

Also from POMC: α-MSH (melanocyte stimulating), β-MSH, γ-MSH
```

### Key POMC Expression Sites

| Site | Primary products | Function |
|---|---|---|
| **Anterior pituitary** (corticotrophs) | ACTH + β-LPH | Stress axis (HPA); cortisol release |
| **Arcuate nucleus** (hypothalamus) | β-Endorphin | Analgesia, reward, feeding behaviour |
| **Nucleus tractus solitarius** | β-Endorphin | Autonomic pain modulation |
| **Immune cells** (lymphocytes, monocytes) | β-Endorphin | Peripheral analgesia; immunomodulation |

## Synthesis Pathway: Enkephalins (Proenkephalin Pathway)

```
Dietary Amino Acids → Translation
      │
      │ [Proenkephalin A gene → mRNA → protein]
      │  Contains 4× Met-enkephalin, 1× Leu-enkephalin, 2× extended forms
      ▼
Proenkephalin A (267 amino acids)
      │
      │ [PC1 / PC2] — Cleavage at dibasic sites
      │  Cofactors: Ca²⁺, active vesicular pH, Zn²⁺
      ▼
Met-enkephalin (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met)
Leu-enkephalin (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu)
      │
      │ C-terminal amidation (some extended forms):
      │ [PAM — Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase]
      │  Cofactors: Vitamin C, Cu²⁺, O₂
      ▼
Amidated enkephalin (more potent/stable)
```

## Post-Translational Processing Cofactors

All endogenous opioid peptides require extensive post-translational processing:

| Step | Enzyme | Cofactors Required |
|---|---|---|
| **Signal peptide cleavage** | Signal peptidase | — (ER membrane process) |
| **Proprotein cleavage** | PC1, PC2 | **Ca²⁺**, Zn²⁺, appropriate pH |
| **C-terminal amidation** | PAM (PHM + PAL domains) | **Vitamin C (ascorbate)**, **Cu²⁺**, O₂ |
| **N-terminal acetylation** | NAT | Acetyl-CoA **(Pantothenate / B5)** |
| **Tyrosine hydroxylation** (Tyr in peptide) | Prolyl hydroxylase | **Vitamin C**, Fe²⁺, O₂, α-KG |
| **Disulfide bond formation** | PDI (ER) | Oxidising environment; no specific vitamin |

> **Vitamin C note** — PAM is required for C-terminal amidation of ~50% of known neuropeptides (including enkephalins, substance P, oxytocin, CRH). Each catalytic cycle consumes 1 ascorbate. This makes Vitamin C critically important for the activity of the entire neuropeptide signalling system.

## Degradation Pathway

Enkephalins and endorphins are **rapidly degraded** (half-life seconds to minutes in synapse):

```
Met/Leu-Enkephalin
      │
      ├──► [APN — Aminopeptidase N / CD13]
      │     Cleaves N-terminal Tyr residue
      │     Cofactor: Zn²⁺ (zinc metalloprotease)
      │
      ├──► [NEP — Neutral Endopeptidase / Neprilysin / CD10]
      │     Cleaves Gly3-Phe4 bond
      │     Cofactor: Zn²⁺, Ca²⁺
      │
      ├──► [ECE — Endothelin-converting enzyme]
      │     Also degrades enkephalins
      │
      └──► [DPP — Dipeptidyl peptidase IV]
           Cleaves Pro-containing enkephalins

All generate: amino acid fragments → recycled into protein pool
```

**β-Endorphin degradation:**
- Longer peptide → slower degradation (minutes–hours)
- **Carboxypeptidase E (CPE)** removes C-terminal amino acids
- **Aminopeptidases** degrade from N-terminus after carboxypeptidase action
