# Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)

## Overview
Vitamin C, chemically known as **L-ascorbic acid**, is a water-soluble vitamin and powerful antioxidant. It is unique in that most mammals synthesise their own vitamin C (from glucose via the gulonolactone oxidase enzyme), but humans, other primates, guinea pigs, and some other species have **lost this ability** due to mutation of the GULO gene — making dietary intake essential.

Vitamin C first gained clinical recognition in the 18th century through James Lind's work on scurvy in sailors, and was isolated in 1928 by Albert Szent-Györgyi.

## Functions
- **Collagen Biosynthesis:** Cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases — enzymes that hydroxylate proline and lysine in procollagen, essential for the triple-helix collagen structure. Without vitamin C, collagen is unstable → scurvy.
- **Antioxidant:** Directly neutralises reactive oxygen species (superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, hypochlorous acid) and regenerates oxidised vitamin E (tocopheryl radical → alpha-tocopherol).
- **Non-Haem Iron Absorption:** Reduces Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺ in the gut, making non-haem iron 2–3x more bioavailable.
- **Carnitine Synthesis:** Required for two hydroxylation steps in carnitine synthesis — carnitine transports fatty acids into mitochondria for beta-oxidation.
- **Catecholamine Synthesis:** Cofactor for dopamine beta-hydroxylase (dopamine → norepinephrine).
- **Immune Function:** Stimulates proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes; supports neutrophil function; enhances NK cell activity; reduces duration/severity of colds in high-risk groups.
- **Wound Healing:** Via collagen synthesis and immune support.
- **Drug Metabolism:** Modulates CYP450 oxidase activity.
- **Epigenetic Regulation:** Cofactor for TET enzymes that demethylate DNA — implications in cancer prevention and stem cell function.

## Cofactors Needed
Vitamin C itself IS a cofactor for:
| Enzyme | Function |
|---|---|
| Prolyl hydroxylase | Collagen hydroxylation |
| Lysyl hydroxylase | Collagen hydroxylation |
| Dopamine beta-hydroxylase | Catecholamine synthesis |
| Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase | Neuropeptide maturation |
| HIF prolyl hydroxylase | Hypoxia signalling regulation |
| TET enzymes | DNA demethylation (epigenetic regulation) |

All these enzymes require vitamin C to maintain their metal centres (iron or copper) in the reduced (active) state.

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Active sodium-dependent cotransport (SVCT1/SVCT2) + passive diffusion; absorption decreases at higher oral doses (saturable) |
| **Absorption rate at low doses** | >90% |
| **Absorption rate at 1,250 mg** | ~33% |
| **Peak plasma concentration** | Plateaus at ~70–80 µM with oral intake; up to 30–70× higher with IV administration |
| **Distribution** | Brain, adrenal glands, and eye concentrated highly; white blood cells carry 50–100× plasma levels |
| **Plasma Half-Life** | 10–20 days (normal stores); ~2 hours at high IV doses |
| **Excretion** | Kidneys; as ascorbic acid, dehydroascorbic acid, and oxalate |
| **Renal threshold** | Plasma >0.8 mg/dL; excess excreted in urine |

## Effects of Deficiency (Scurvy)
Scurvy develops after 4–12 weeks of severe vitamin C deprivation (<10 mg/day). Historically a disease of sailors, it remains relevant in the elderly, homeless, and those with food insecurity.

**Symptoms:**
- **Connective Tissue (earliest signs):** Corkscrew hair, perifollicular haemorrhages
- **Gingival:** Spongy, bleeding, swollen gums → tooth loss (perimyolysis)
- **Skin:** Petechiae, purpura, large bruises
- **Musculoskeletal:** Subperiosteal haemorrhages, bone pain, arthralgia
- **Anaemia:** Due to impaired iron absorption + capillary fragility
- **Wound Healing Failure:** Old wounds may reopen
- **Mood:** Depression, fatigue, irritability

**At-Risk Groups:**
- Those with poor fruit/vegetable intake (poverty, eating disorders)
- Older adults living alone
- Alcohol use disorder
- Patients on dialysis
- Those with malabsorption syndromes

## Treatment Protocols
| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Mild deficiency | Increase fruit/vegetable intake; 200–500 mg/day |
| Scurvy | 500–1,000 mg/day oral for 1–2 weeks, then nutritious diet |
| Severe/hospitalised patients | IV ascorbic acid as needed |
| Iron absorption enhancement | 100–200 mg vitamin C with iron-rich meals |
| High-dose IV (oncology/sepsis) | 10–25 g IV (investigational; not standard of care) |

## Drug Interactions
| Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| Warfarin | High-dose vitamin C may reduce warfarin efficacy (disputed) |
| Statins + Niacin | Vitamin C may reduce HDL-raising effect of niacin-statin combo |
| Chemotherapy drugs | May reduce cell-damaging effects (pro-oxidant suppression); controversial — avoid during certain chemotherapy |
| Aluminium antacids | Vitamin C increases aluminium absorption |
| Protease inhibitors (indinavir, saquinavir) | May reduce drug levels |
| Estrogens (OCP/HRT) | Vitamin C may increase oestrogen bioavailability |
| Iron supplements | Vitamin C significantly increases non-haem iron absorption |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Vitamin C (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Red bell pepper (raw) | ½ cup | ~95 mg |
| Kiwi | 1 medium | ~71 mg |
| Orange (fresh) | 1 medium | ~70 mg |
| Broccoli (cooked) | ½ cup | ~51 mg |
| Strawberries | ½ cup | ~49 mg |
| Brussels sprouts (cooked) | ½ cup | ~48 mg |
| Grapefruit | ½ fruit | ~39 mg |
| Potato (baked) | 1 medium | ~17 mg |

> **Stability note:** Vitamin C is the most sensitive of all vitamins. It is destroyed by heat, oxygen, light, and alkaline conditions. Prefer raw or lightly steamed vegetables. Cooking water contains leached vitamin C — use for soups.

## Storage & Stability
- Very sensitive to **heat, oxygen, and light**
- Rapidly degraded in alkaline conditions
- Use fresh produce promptly; refrigeration slows degradation
- Avoid copper cookware (catalyses oxidation)

## Toxicity
| Dose | Risk |
|---|---|
| > 2,000 mg/day | GI upset, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal cramps |
| High doses (chronic) | Oxalate kidney stones (increased oxalate excretion) — especially in those with kidney disease or history of stones |
| Very high IV doses | Pro-oxidant effects; haemolytic anaemia in G6PD-deficient patients |

> **Rebound scurvy:** Rapid withdrawal from very high-dose supplementation may cause rebound deficiency in newborns of mothers supplementing heavily.
