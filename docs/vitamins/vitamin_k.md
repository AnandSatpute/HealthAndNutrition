# Vitamin K (Phylloquinone / Menaquinone)

## Overview
Vitamin K is a **fat-soluble vitamin** that exists in two main naturally-occurring forms:

- **Vitamin K1 (Phylloquinone):** Found in green leafy plants; the primary dietary form.
- **Vitamin K2 (Menaquinones, MK-4 to MK-13):** Produced by bacteria in fermented foods and the gut; also produced in tissues from K1. Sub-types differ by length of their isoprenoid side chain.
  - **MK-4:** Short-chain, found in animal products; rapidly converted from K1 in the body
  - **MK-7:** Long-chain, from natto (fermented soybeans); has longest half-life and greatest bone/vascular effect per dose

A synthetic form, **Vitamin K3 (Menadione)**, is no longer used due to toxicity.

Vitamin K was named from the German "Koagulationsvitamin" — its essential role in coagulation.

## Requirements (Adequate Intake)
The RDA for vitamin K has not been formally established. An **Adequate Intake (AI)** is used:

| Age / Group | AI |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 2 mcg/day |
| Infants 7–12 months | 2.5 mcg/day |
| Children 1–3 years | 30 mcg/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 55 mcg/day |
| Children 9–13 years | 60 mcg/day |
| Adolescents 14–18 years | 75 mcg/day |
| Adult Men (19+) | 120 mcg/day |
| Adult Women (19+) | 90 mcg/day |
| Pregnant Women | 90 mcg/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 90 mcg/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** None established for K1 or K2 — no adverse effects from high dietary or supplemental intake. (K3/menadione is restricted due to toxicity.)

## Functions
Vitamin K functions as a **cofactor for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase** — an enzyme that activates vitamin K-dependent (VKD) proteins by carboxylating their glutamic acid residues (Gla), enabling them to bind calcium.

**Haemostasis (Blood Clotting):**
Activates clotting factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, X, and anticoagulant proteins C, S, and Z.

| Protein | Role |
|---|---|
| Prothrombin (Factor II) | Converted to thrombin → activates fibrin clot formation |
| Factor VII | Extrinsic pathway protease |
| Factor IX | Intrinsic pathway protease |
| Factor X | Common pathway protease |
| Protein C + S | Natural anticoagulants; prevent excessive clotting |
| Protein Z | Inhibits Factor Xa |

**Bone Metabolism:**
- **Osteocalcin (BGP):** Binds calcium in bone mineral; promotes bone formation and quality.
- **Matrix Gla-Protein (MGP):** Inhibits arterial calcification — inhibits calcium crystal formation in vascular tissue.

**Vascular Health:**
K2 in particular is critical for preventing arterial stiffness by activating MGP — carboxylated MGP inhibits calcium deposition in arterial walls.

## Cofactors Needed
Vitamin K itself acts as a cofactor. The vitamin K cycle requires:

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| **Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase** | The enzyme activated by vitamin K; carboxylates VKD proteins |
| **Vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR)** | Regenerates active vitamin K from its epoxide form — target of warfarin |
| **CO₂ and O₂** | Co-substrates for the carboxylation reaction |
| **Vitamin D** | Works synergistically — D induces osteocalcin expression; K activates it |
| **Calcium** | Carboxylated Gla proteins bind calcium; mineral needed for function |

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | K1 (Phylloquinone) | K2 / MK-7 |
|---|---|---|
| **Sources** | Green leafy vegetables | Fermented foods, gut bacteria, animal products |
| **Absorption** | 4–17% from vegetables; much better from oils/supplements; requires fat + bile | Higher from fermented foods |
| **Distribution** | Liver (short-term); cleared rapidly | Widely distributed including blood vessels, bone |
| **Half-Life** | ~1–2 hours (very short) | MK-7: ~3 days; MK-9: ~60 hours |
| **Metabolism** | Converted to inactive urinary metabolites | Similar pathway, but slower clearance of long-chain MKs |
| **Excretion** | ~20% urine, 40–50% feces via bile | Similar |
| **Body Stores** | Very limited; rapid turnover | Stored longer due to longer half-life |

> Note: Because K1 has such a short half-life, daily intake is more important. K2 (especially MK-7) has a longer half-life and accumulates over time — closer to a single weekly dose being effective.

## Effects of Deficiency
Vitamin K deficiency is **rare in healthy adults** but can be clinically significant in certain groups.

**Primary Risk: Haemorrhage**
- Easy bruising, petechiae (tiny blood spots)
- Prolonged bleeding from cuts
- Heavy menstrual bleeding
- Blood in urine (haematuria) or dark, tarry stools (GI bleeding)

**Neonatal (Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding — VKDB):**
- Severity ranges from mild bruising to life-threatening intracranial haemorrhage
- Newborns are at high risk due to: low transplacental transfer, low breast milk K content, sterile/immature gut (no bacterial K2 synthesis)
- **Treatment:** Single IM injection of vitamin K at birth is standard worldwide

**Bone Effects (Chronic/Subclinical):**
- Uncarboxylated osteocalcin impairs bone mineral density
- Associated with increased fracture risk

**At-Risk Groups:**
- Newborns (not given IM vitamin K at birth)
- Patients on long-term antibiotic therapy (reduces gut bacteria K2 production)
- Individuals with fat malabsorption disorders (celiac, cystic fibrosis, Crohn's, liver disease)
- Patients on warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists

**Lab Diagnosis:**
- Prothrombin Time (PT) / INR — elevated in deficiency
- PIVKA-II (Protein Induced by Vitamin K Absence) — sensitive marker

## Treatment Protocols
| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Neonatal VKDB prevention (everywhere) | 1 mg IM vitamin K at birth |
| Acute K deficiency bleeding | 10 mg IV phytomenadione; repeat in 4–8 hours if needed |
| Warfarin reversal (urgent) | IV vitamin K 1–5 mg (slow infusion) + fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate |
| Warfarin reversal (non-urgent) | Oral vitamin K 1–5 mg; hold warfarin doses |
| Dietary deficiency | 90–120 mcg/day oral phylloquinone; dietary improvements |
| Bone health (adjunct) | K2 (MK-7) 100–300 mcg/day combined with vitamin D3 and calcium |

## Drug Interactions
| Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Warfarin (Coumadin)** | **Most critical interaction** — warfarin inhibits VKOR, blocking vitamin K recycling. Changes in K intake alter warfarin's anticoagulant effect — maintain consistent K intake |
| Antibiotics (prolonged) | Destroy gut bacteria → reduced K2 synthesis → coagulation risk |
| Orlistat | Reduces absorption of fat-soluble vitamins including K |
| Cholestyramine / Colestipol | Bile acid sequestrants reduce K absorption |
| Mineral oil | Reduces K absorption |
| NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) | Unclear anticoagulation interactions; exercise caution |
| Anticonvulsants | May induce K catabolism |

## Storage & Stability
- Relatively stable to heat — cooking does not appreciably destroy K1 in vegetables
- Sensitive to **light and UV radiation** — store in opaque containers
- Keep oils away from light and air to prevent vitamin K degradation
- Absorption enhanced when consumed with dietary fat (fat-soluble)

---

## Toxicity
Vitamin K1 and K2 have an **extremely low toxicity profile**. No Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) has been established by the FDA or EFSA for K1 or K2.

- High intake from green vegetables or supplements has **no reported adverse effects**
- Historical toxicity involved only synthetic **Vitamin K3 (Menadione)** — now banned due to haemolytic anaemia and kernicterus in neonates

**Cautions:**
- Patients on warfarin: Large changes in vitamin K intake can destabilise anticoagulation (do not avoid; maintain consistency)
- Patients with severe liver disease: Impaired clotting may worsen even with K administration — specialist management required
- Dialysis patients: Should discuss supplementation with their care team
