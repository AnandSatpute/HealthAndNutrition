# Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)

## Overview
Vitamin B2, also known as **riboflavin**, is a water-soluble B-group vitamin essential for energy production, cellular function, and the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. It was first isolated in the 1920s and chemically characterized in 1934.

- **Chemical nature:** It contains an isoalloxazine ring fused to a ribitol side chain, giving it a characteristic yellow-orange fluorescence.
- **Solubility:** Soluble in water; not retained in body fat. Intestinal absorption is saturable (~27 mg per dose maximum), limiting efficacy of very high oral doses.
- **Storage:** Not stored in large quantities in the body — daily intake is essential.

## Requirements (RDA)
The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for riboflavin by age and sex:

| Age / Group | RDA |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 0.3 mg/day (AI) |
| Infants 7–12 months | 0.4 mg/day (AI) |
| Children 1–3 years | 0.5 mg/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 0.6 mg/day |
| Children 9–13 years | 0.9 mg/day |
| Adolescents 14–18 (male) | 1.3 mg/day |
| Adolescents 14–18 (female) | 1.0 mg/day |
| Adult Men (19+) | 1.3 mg/day |
| Adult Women (19+) | 1.1 mg/day |
| Pregnant Women | 1.4 mg/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 1.6 mg/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** None established — riboflavin has very low toxicity due to limited intestinal absorption and rapid renal excretion.

## Functions
Riboflavin's roles span energy metabolism, antioxidant defence, and nutrient activation:

- **Energy Production:** Integral to the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. FADH₂ donates electrons at **Complex II** of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC).
- **Fatty Acid Beta-Oxidation:** FAD is required by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzymes that break down fatty acids in the mitochondrial matrix.
- **Antioxidant Defence:** Cofactor for **glutathione reductase**, regenerating reduced glutathione to neutralise reactive oxygen species (ROS).
- **Nutrient Activation:** Converts:
  - Vitamin B6 → pyridoxal phosphate (active coenzyme form)
  - Tryptophan → Niacin (Vitamin B3)
  - Folate → active tetrahydrofolate derivatives
- **Iron Mobilisation:** Required by xanthine oxidase to mobilise iron from ferritin storage.
- **Homocysteine Regulation:** Riboflavin-dependent MTHFR enzyme helps reduce plasma homocysteine, lowering cardiovascular risk.
- **Drug Metabolism:** CYP450 enzymes (cytochrome P450 system) are flavoproteins dependent on FAD/FMN.
- **Thyroid Hormone Synthesis:** Riboflavin-dependent enzymes are involved in thyroid hormone production.
- **Cellular Growth & Development:** Supports skin integrity, ocular health, neurological function, and fetal development.
- **Migraine Prophylaxis:** High-dose riboflavin (400 mg/day) reduces migraine frequency — proposed mechanism is correction of mitochondrial energy deficits in susceptible neurons.

## Cofactors Needed
Riboflavin is the precursor to two essential coenzymes (collectively called **flavocoenzymes**):

1. **Flavin Mononucleotide (FMN)** — riboflavin-5'-phosphate; first phosphorylation step.
2. **Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD)** — the more abundant form; FAD is synthesised from FMN + AMP.

**Biochemical role:** Both FAD and FMN accept and donate **2 electrons + 2 protons**, cycling between oxidised (FAD/FMN) and reduced (FADH₂/FMNH₂) states — central to all redox reactions.

**Enzyme classes dependent on flavocoenzymes:**
- Oxidases (e.g., xanthine oxidase, monoamine oxidase)
- Dehydrogenases (e.g., succinate dehydrogenase in the citric acid cycle)
- Monooxygenases (e.g., CYP450 enzymes)

> Note: In some enzymes, FAD/FMN is **covalently bound** and cannot be recycled or recovered by the body, making riboflavin status critical.

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Active carrier-mediated transport in the small intestine; saturable at ~27 mg/dose; bile salts enhance absorption |
| **Distribution** | Primarily liver, kidneys, and cardiac muscle; circulates bound to plasma proteins |
| **Metabolism** | Riboflavin → FMN (via riboflavin kinase) → FAD (via FAD synthetase) |
| **Elimination half-life** | ~66–84 minutes after a single oral/IM dose |
| **Absorption half-life** | ~1.1 hours |
| **Excretion** | Renally excreted; urine turns bright yellow at high doses (riboflavinuria — harmless and expected) |
| **Bioavailability** | Up to ~95% from food; significantly reduced by alcohol use |

## Effects of Deficiency (Ariboflavinosis)
Deficiency is rare in isolation and usually occurs alongside deficiencies of other B vitamins.

**Symptoms include:**
- **Oral:** Angular stomatitis (sores at mouth corners), cheilosis (cracked lips), glossitis (swollen magenta tongue), pharyngitis (sore throat)
- **Ocular:** Photophobia, excessive tearing, corneal vascularisation; cataracts in severe/prolonged cases
- **Skin:** Seborrhoeic dermatitis, especially around the nose, ears, and genitalia
- **Haematological:** Normochromic normocytic anaemia
- **Neurological:** Peripheral neuropathy (rare)

**At-Risk Populations:**
- Vegans and strict vegetarians (limited animal product intake)
- Individuals with alcohol use disorder (impaired absorption and utilisation)
- Athletes (increased metabolic demand)
- Elderly adults (reduced intake and absorption)
- Patients with anorexia, malabsorption syndromes (e.g., IBD, coeliac disease)
- Those on certain medications (see Drug Interactions)
- Neonates under prolonged phototherapy (riboflavin is photodegraded)

**Laboratory Diagnosis:**
- **Erythrocyte Glutathione Reductase Activation Coefficient (EGR-AC):** Gold standard — values >1.4 indicate deficiency
- **Urinary riboflavin excretion:** <27 µg/day suggests deficiency

## Treatment Protocols

| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Mild dietary deficiency | 5–10 mg/day oral, plus dietary correction |
| Clinical ariboflavinosis | 10–30 mg/day oral in divided doses until symptoms resolve |
| Migraine prophylaxis | 400 mg/day oral (evidence-based, under medical supervision) |
| Severe deficiency / malabsorption | IV or IM riboflavin as part of a multi-B complex |
| Neonatal jaundice (phototherapy) | IV supplementation as B2 is degraded by phototherapy light |

- Supplements are most effective when taken **with food** (enhances absorption).
- Treatment of co-existing B-vitamin deficiencies is essential since they commonly co-occur.

## Drug Interactions
Certain drugs reduce riboflavin absorption, excretion, or efficacy:

| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) | Inhibit riboflavin incorporation into flavocoenzymes |
| Phenothiazines (e.g., chlorpromazine) | Reduce FAD synthesis |
| Antimalarials (e.g., probenecid) | Block renal tubular reabsorption → increased urinary loss |
| Metformin | May interfere with riboflavin metabolism |
| Doxorubicin (chemotherapy) | Competes with riboflavin at cellular binding sites |
| Alcohol | Impairs both absorption and conversion to active coenzymes |

## Food Sources
Riboflavin is found in both animal and plant foods. **Key note:** riboflavin is highly sensitive to UV light — milk in clear bottles can lose up to 50% of its riboflavin content within 2 hours of light exposure.

| Food | Serving | Riboflavin (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Beef liver (cooked) | 85g | ~2.9 mg |
| Fortified breakfast cereal | 1 cup | 1.3–2.3 mg |
| Milk (whole, cow) | 240 ml | ~0.4 mg |
| Yogurt (plain, low-fat) | 245g | ~0.6 mg |
| Chicken breast (cooked) | 85g | ~0.2 mg |
| Salmon (cooked) | 85g | ~0.2 mg |
| Eggs (whole, large) | 1 egg | ~0.2 mg |
| Almonds | 28g (1 oz) | ~0.3 mg |
| Mushrooms (cooked) | 86g (½ cup) | ~0.2 mg |
| Spinach (cooked) | 90g (½ cup) | ~0.2 mg |

## Storage & Stability
- **Light-sensitive:** Destroyed rapidly by UV/visible light — store foods in opaque or non-transparent packaging.
- **Heat-stable:** Cooking losses are generally low; does not degrade significantly at normal cooking temperatures.
- **Water-soluble:** Can leach into boiling water — using cooking water in soups can recover nutrients.

## Toxicity
No toxicity has been established from food or supplement sources. Because intestinal absorption is saturable and excess is rapidly excreted renally, risk of toxicity is extremely low. No Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) has been set by any major dietary authority.
