# Vitamin B7 (Biotin)

## Overview
Vitamin B7, also known as **biotin** (or formerly vitamin H, from the German "Haar und Haut" — hair and skin), is a water-soluble B vitamin. Unlike other B vitamins, biotin does not function as a simple coenzyme — it is covalently bound (as a **prosthetic group**) to five crucial carboxylase enzymes. Biotin deficiency is rare but significant in special clinical populations, and it has unique interactions with laboratory diagnostics.

## Requirements (AI)
A formal **RDA** has not been established for biotin due to insufficient evidence. An **Adequate Intake (AI)** is used:

| Age / Group | AI |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 5 mcg/day |
| Infants 7–12 months | 6 mcg/day |
| Children 1–3 years | 8 mcg/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 12 mcg/day |
| Children 9–13 years | 20 mcg/day |
| Adolescents 14–18 years | 25 mcg/day |
| Adults (19+) | 30 mcg/day |
| Pregnant Women | 30 mcg/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 35 mcg/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** None established — no adverse effects reported from high oral doses, but biotin interferes with lab tests (see Drug Interactions).

## Functions
Biotin serves as a prosthetic group covalently attached to five mammalian carboxylase enzymes:

| Enzyme | Pathway |
|---|---|
| **Pyruvate Carboxylase (PC)** | Gluconeogenesis (converts pyruvate → oxaloacetate) |
| **Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase 1 (ACC1)** | Fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA → malonyl-CoA) |
| **Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase 2 (ACC2)** | Regulates mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation |
| **Methylcrotonyl-CoA Carboxylase (MCC)** | Leucine metabolism |
| **Propionyl-CoA Carboxylase (PCC)** | Metabolism of odd-chain fatty acids and certain amino acids |

**Additional roles:**
- **Gene Expression:** Biotin regulates gene expression via histone biotinylation (epigenetic control)
- **Cell Signalling:** Participates in activation of soluble guanylate cyclase
- **Skin, Hair, Nail Health:** Supports keratin infrastructure (widely marketed but evidence for supplementation in non-deficient individuals is limited)
- **Neurological Function:** Supports CNS myelination and neurotransmitter activity

## Cofactors Needed
Biotin is itself a cofactor, covalently attached to enzymes by:
| Enzyme | Role |
|---|---|
| **Holocarboxylase Synthetase (HCS)** | Attaches biotin to apocarboxylase proteins to form active holoenyzmes |
| **Biotinidase** | Recycles biotin by releasing it from biotinylated histones and degraded holocarboxylase products |

---

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Active carrier-mediated transport in small intestine; also passively diffused at high doses |
| **Gut Bacteria** | Intestinal microflora produce some biotin, though contribution to human requirements is unclear |
| **Peak Plasma Concentration** | 1–2 hours after oral intake |
| **Distribution** | Widely distributed; highest concentrations in liver |
| **Elimination Half-Life** | 1.8–18.8 hours (dose-dependent) |
| **Metabolism** | Metabolised to bisnorbiotin and biotin sulfoxide |
| **Excretion** | Primarily renal |
| **Clearance** | Rapid; high doses clear within ~1 week |

## Effects of Deficiency
Biotin deficiency is rare in healthy individuals consuming a balanced diet. Symptomatic deficiency typically follows prolonged raw egg white consumption, total parenteral nutrition, or genetic disorders.

**Symptoms:**
- **Skin:** Seborrhoeic dermatitis; scaly, erythematous rash around the eyes, nose, mouth, and perianal region ("biotin-deficient facies")
- **Hair:** Alopecia (hair thinning/loss)
- **Neurological:** Lethargy, depression, hallucinations, paraesthesia, ataxia, seizures
- **Ocular:** Conjunctivitis
- **Other:** Brittle nails, fatigue, muscle pain

**At-Risk Groups:**
- Individuals consuming large quantities of **raw egg whites** (avidin protein binds biotin irreversibly)
- Long-term antibiotic use (disrupts gut bacteria biotin production)
- Biotinidase deficiency (autosomal recessive; neonatal screening recommended)
- Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency
- Prolonged total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without biotin supplementation
- Smokers (increased biotin catabolism)
- Pregnant women (sub-marginal biotin status is common)

## Treatment Protocols
| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Dietary biotin deficiency | 5–10 mg/day oral biotin; correct diet |
| Biotinidase deficiency | 5–10 mg/day oral (lifelong) |
| Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency | 10–40 mg/day or higher (titrated to response) |
| Biotin–thiamin-responsive basal ganglia disease | Lifelong biotin 5–10 mg/kg/day + thiamine 300 mg/day |

---

## Drug Interactions

| Drug / Substance | Effect |
|---|---|
| Anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone) | Increase biotin catabolism; reduce intestinal absorption → deficiency risk |
| Antibiotics (prolonged use) | Reduce gut bacteria biotin production |
| Raw egg whites (avidin) | Binds biotin in gut, preventing absorption |
| Smoking | Accelerates biotin catabolism |
| **⚠️ Lab Test Interference** | **High-dose biotin interferes with biotin-streptavidin immunoassays used in clinical diagnostics — can cause falsely HIGH or LOW results for: thyroid hormones (TSH, T3, T4), cardiac troponin, Vitamin D, testosterone, FSH, LH, cortisol, prolactin** |

> **Clinical Alert:** Patients taking >5 mg/day of biotin supplements should stop supplementation at least **72 hours before blood tests** to prevent diagnostic interference.

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Biotin (mcg) |
|---|---|---|
| Beef liver (cooked) | 75g | ~33 mcg |
| Egg (whole, cooked) | 1 large | ~10 mcg |
| Salmon (cooked) | 85g | ~5 mcg |
| Pork (cooked) | 85g | ~3.8 mcg |
| Sunflower seeds | 28g | ~2.6 mcg |
| Sweet potato (cooked) | 1 medium | ~2.5 mcg |
| Almonds | 28g | ~1.5 mcg |
| Spinach (cooked) | 90g | ~0.5 mcg |

> **Note:** Cooking eggs denatures avidin and restores biotin bioavailability. Raw egg consumption regularly should be avoided.

## Storage & Stability
- Sensitive to heat at high temperatures; some losses in cooking
- Water-soluble; can leach into cooking liquid
- Sensitive to oxidation

## Toxicity
No known toxicity from oral or IV administration. No Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) established. The primary concern at high doses is **laboratory test interference** (see Drug Interactions), not physiological toxicity.
