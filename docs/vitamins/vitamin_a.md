# Vitamin A (Retinol)

## Overview
Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for vision, immune function, cell growth, and reproduction. It exists in two primary dietary forms:
- **Preformed Vitamin A (Retinol):** Found in animal products; directly bioavailable.
- **Provitamin A Carotenoids (e.g., Beta-Carotene):** Found in plants; converted by the body to retinol with variable efficiency (5–65%).

First isolated in 1913, it was one of the first vitamins to be discovered. It is stored extensively in the liver and can accumulate to toxic levels.

## Requirements (RDA)
Expressed as **Retinol Activity Equivalents (RAE)**:

| Age / Group | RDA |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 400 mcg RAE/day (AI) |
| Infants 7–12 months | 500 mcg RAE/day (AI) |
| Children 1–3 years | 300 mcg RAE/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 400 mcg RAE/day |
| Children 9–13 years | 600 mcg RAE/day |
| Adolescents (males 14–18) | 900 mcg RAE/day |
| Adolescents (females 14–18) | 700 mcg RAE/day |
| Adult Men (19+) | 900 mcg RAE/day |
| Adult Women (19+) | 700 mcg RAE/day |
| Pregnant Women | 770 mcg RAE/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 1,300 mcg RAE/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 3,000 mcg RAE/day of preformed vitamin A for adults. No UL for provitamin A carotenoids.

## Functions
- **Vision:** Combines with opsin to form rhodopsin in the retina — essential for night (scotopic) vision.
- **Gene Regulation:** Retinoic acid (active metabolite) binds to nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR) to regulate gene expression for cell differentiation.
- **Immune Defence:** Maintains integrity of skin and mucosal barriers; enhances white blood cell function.
- **Cell Growth & Differentiation:** Regulates development of virtually all cell types; critical for organogenesis in the embryo.
- **Reproduction:** Supports spermatogenesis and fetal development.
- **Skin Health:** Promotes keratinocyte turnover, collagen synthesis, and sebum regulation.
- **Antioxidant (via beta-carotene):** Provitamin A carotenoids scavenge reactive oxygen species.

## Cofactors Needed
Vitamin A's metabolism depends on several nutrients:
| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Zinc** | Required for retinol-binding protein (RBP) synthesis and retinol → retinal conversion |
| **Vitamin C** | Supports antioxidant function of carotenoids |
| **Vitamin E** | Protects vitamin A from oxidation in storage |
| **Dietary Fat** | Required for absorption (fat-soluble vitamin) |

---

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Preformed (retinol): 70–90% absorbed; Provitamin A: 5–65% (highly variable) |
| **Distribution** | 90% stored in liver as retinyl esters; smaller amounts in lungs and kidneys |
| **Active Form** | Retinol → retinal (reversible) → retinoic acid (irreversible) |
| **Liver Storage Half-Life** | 200–300 days (well-nourished individuals) |
| **Plasma Half-Life (retinyl palmitate)** | ~2.2 hours (initial phase) |
| **Retinoic Acid Half-Life** | ~2 minutes (rapid turnover) |
| **Excretion** | Metabolites excreted in urine and feces; small amounts via breath |

## Effects of Deficiency
Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is the leading cause of preventable blindness in children worldwide, common in developing countries.

**Symptoms:**
- **Ocular:** Night blindness (earliest sign), xerophthalmia (dry eyes), Bitot's spots, corneal ulceration/keratomalacia → permanent blindness
- **Skin:** Follicular hyperkeratosis (rough, bumpy skin)
- **Immune:** Increased susceptibility to infections (especially measles, respiratory, GI)
- **Growth:** Stunted growth in children

**At-Risk Groups:**
- Populations with maize/rice-dominant diets
- Those with fat malabsorption (Crohn's, celiac, cystic fibrosis)
- Individuals taking Orlistat
- Patients with liver disease

## Treatment Protocols
| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Mild deficiency | Dietary improvement; low-dose retinol supplementation |
| Moderate/severe deficiency | 200,000 IU oral retinol for 2 days + repeat after 2 weeks |
| Night blindness | 10,000–20,000 IU/day for 2 weeks |
| VAD in pre-school children (WHO) | 200,000 IU every 4–6 months |
| Toxicity cessation | Stop all supplements immediately; symptoms usually resolve |

---

## Drug Interactions
| Drug / Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| Oral retinoids (isotretinoin, tretinoin) | Additive toxicity; avoid concurrent high-dose vitamin A |
| Orlistat | Reduces absorption of vitamin A |
| Warfarin | High-dose vitamin A increases bleeding risk |
| Tetracycline antibiotics | Combined use may increase intracranial pressure |
| Oral contraceptives | May increase circulating vitamin A levels |
| Alcohol (chronic) | Depletes liver stores; enhances hepatotoxicity |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Vitamin A (mcg RAE) |
|---|---|---|
| Beef liver (cooked) | 85g | ~6,582 mcg |
| Sweet potato (cooked) | 1 medium | ~1,403 mcg |
| Carrot (raw) | 1 medium | ~509 mcg |
| Spinach (cooked) | 90g | ~472 mcg |
| Fortified milk | 240 ml | ~149 mcg |
| Egg (whole) | 1 large | ~80 mcg |
| Salmon | 85g | ~59 mcg |
| Mango | 1 fruit | ~181 mcg |

## Toxicity (Hypervitaminosis A)
Toxicity only occurs from preformed vitamin A, NOT beta-carotene.

| Type | Cause | Symptoms |
|---|---|---|
| **Acute** | Single large dose (>660,000 IU) | Nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, dizziness |
| **Chronic** | Prolonged intake >3,000 mcg RAE/day | Liver damage, hair loss, dry skin, bone pain, headaches, intracranial hypertension |
| **Teratogenic** | High doses during pregnancy | Birth defects (cardiovascular, CNS malformations) |

**Treatment:** Stop all vitamin A supplementation immediately. Liver damage, if severe, may be irreversible.

## Storage & Stability
- **Light-sensitive:** Degrades in strong UV light.
- **Heat-stable:** Cooking does not significantly destroy retinol.
- **Fat-soluble:** Found predominantly in fatty foods; not destroyed by cooking.
