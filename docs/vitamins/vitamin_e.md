# Vitamin E (Tocopherol)

## Overview
Vitamin E is a **fat-soluble antioxidant** that exists in eight natural forms:
- **Four tocopherols:** alpha (α), beta (β), gamma (γ), delta (δ)
- **Four tocotrienols:** alpha, beta, gamma, delta

**Alpha-tocopherol (α-tocopherol)** is the only form recognised to meet human requirements and is the form maintained and preferentially distributed by the body. It is the most potent biological form and the only one that reliably raises serum vitamin E levels.

Vitamin E was discovered in 1922 by Evans and Bishop. Its name derives from the Greek "tocos" (childbirth) + "phero" (to carry), reflecting early research on reproductive function in rats.

## Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 4 mg (6 IU)/day (AI) |
| Infants 7–12 months | 5 mg (7.5 IU)/day (AI) |
| Children 1–3 years | 6 mg (9 IU)/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 7 mg (10.4 IU)/day |
| Children 9–13 years | 11 mg (16.4 IU)/day |
| Adolescents 14–18 years | 15 mg (22.4 IU)/day |
| Adults (19+) | 15 mg (22.4 IU)/day |
| Pregnant Women | 15 mg/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 19 mg (28 IU)/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 1,000 mg/day of alpha-tocopherol (synthetic or natural) for adults — primarily due to bleeding risk.

## Functions
- **Primary Antioxidant:** Protects **polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)** in cell membranes from lipid peroxidation by free radicals. Particularly important because cell membranes are rich in PUFAs.
- **Chain-Breaking Antioxidant:** Intercepts lipid radical chain reactions — donates hydrogen to a lipid radical, stops peroxidation cascade.
- **Vitamin E–Vitamin C Cycle:** Oxidised vitamin E (tocopheroxyl radical) is regenerated by vitamin C — the two antioxidants work synergistically.
- **Immune Function:** Enhances T-cell proliferation and cytokine production; supports NK cell activity; anti-inflammatory via inhibition of protein kinase C and NF-κB.
- **Platelet Aggregation:** Inhibits platelet adhesion and aggregation — reduces thrombus formation.
- **Gene Regulation:** Tocopherols and tocotrienols modulate gene expression related to inflammation and cell cycle.
- **Vascular Health:** Inhibits smooth muscle proliferation; reduces LDL oxidation — atherosclerosis prevention (under investigation).
- **Skin Health:** Photoprotection; reduces UV-induced skin damage.
- **Nervous System:** Protects neuronal membranes; peripheral neuropathy hallmark of severe deficiency.

## Cofactors Needed
Unlike B vitamins, vitamin E does not function as an enzyme cofactor in the classical sense. However, it works synergistically with:

| Nutrient | Role |
|---|---|
| **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)** | Regenerates oxidised α-tocopherol (tocopheroxyl radical) back to active form |
| **Selenium** | Works with vitamin E in glutathione peroxidase system to protect membranes from oxidative damage |
| **Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinol)** | Another fat-soluble antioxidant that works alongside vitamin E in membranes |

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | ~55% of oral alpha-tocopherol absorbed; requires dietary fat and bile; absorbed in small intestine |
| **Chylomicron transport** | Packaged into chylomicrons → delivered to liver |
| **Preferential retention** | Liver uses **alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (α-TTP)** to preferentially select alpha-tocopherol for VLDL assembly; other forms are metabolised |
| **Distribution** | Adipose tissue (largest reservoir), liver, muscle, cell membranes |
| **Elimination Half-Life** | ~20 hours (alpha-tocopherol); tocotrienols: 2–4 hours |
| **Metabolism** | Hepatic CYP450 side-chain oxidation → beta-oxidation → CEHC metabolites |
| **Excretion** | Bile/feces (major); urine (minor, as CEHC) |

## Effects of Deficiency
Vitamin E deficiency is rare in healthy adults but significant in populations with fat malabsorption or genetic metabolic abnormalities.

**Causes:**
- Fat malabsorption disorders (abetalipoproteinaemia, cystic fibrosis, Crohn's, celiac, liver disease)
- Mutations in alpha-TTP gene (rare ataxia with vitamin E deficiency — AVED)
- Severely premature infants

**Symptoms:**
- **Neurological (primary manifestation):**
  - Peripheral neuropathy: sensory loss in hands/feet, absent deep tendon reflexes
  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (loss of coordination)
  - Ophthalmoplegia (weakness of eye muscles)
  - Retinopathy
- **Haematological:**
  - Haemolytic anaemia (especially in premature infants — oxidative damage to RBC membranes)
- **Immune:**
  - Impaired immune cell function

**At-Risk Groups:**
- People with fat malabsorption conditions
- Premature infants
- Individuals with AVED (genetic TTP mutation)
- Severe protein-energy malnutrition

## Treatment Protocols
| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Dietary deficiency | Increase dietary vitamin E; 15–200 mg/day supplemental alpha-tocopherol |
| Neurological deficiency (moderate) | High-dose oral: 100–400 mg/day (monitor response) |
| Abetalipoproteinaemia | 1,000–2,000 mg/day or higher; specialist management |
| AVED (genetic) | 800–1,200 mg/day; lifelong supplementation |
| Premature infants | Prophylactic 25 IU/day to prevent haemolytic anaemia and retinopathy |

## Drug Interactions
| Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| Warfarin / other anticoagulants | Vitamin E inhibits platelet aggregation → additive bleeding risk at >300 mg/day; monitor INR |
| Aspirin | Additive antiplatelet effects |
| Cyclosporine (immunosuppressant) | High-dose vitamin E may increase cyclosporine levels |
| Statins + Niacin | Vitamin E may blunt the HDL-raising effect of niacin-statin combination |
| Chemotherapy / radiotherapy | May reduce oxidative cell-killing effect — avoid supplementation during treatment unless specified |
| Fat-soluble vitamin interference | Very high vitamin E can impair absorption of vitamins A, D, K |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Vitamin E (mg alpha-tocopherol) |
|---|---|---|
| Wheat germ oil | 1 tbsp | ~20.3 mg |
| Sunflower seeds (dry roasted) | 28g | ~7.4 mg |
| Almonds (dry roasted) | 28g | ~6.8 mg |
| Sunflower oil | 1 tbsp | ~5.6 mg |
| Hazelnuts (dry roasted) | 28g | ~4.3 mg |
| Peanut butter | 2 tbsp | ~2.9 mg |
| Spinach (cooked) | 90g | ~3.7 mg |
| Avocado | ½ fruit | ~2.1 mg |
| Mango | ½ cup | ~1.5 mg |

---

## Storage & Stability
- Stable to heat in absence of oxygen — cooking at moderate temperatures usually does not substantially reduce vitamin E
- Sensitive to **oxygen and UV light** — oils stored in dark, airtight containers preserve vitamin E longer
- Destroyed by high-heat frying and industrial refining of vegetable oils

## Toxicity
Vitamin E has low toxicity from food sources. The UL applies to supplemental alpha-tocopherol:

| Risk | Details |
|---|---|
| Haemorrhagic risk | >1,000 mg/day — impairs platelet aggregation; increases bleeding, especially with anticoagulants |
| GI symptoms | High doses: nausea, diarrhoea, fatigue, headache |
| Prostate cancer risk (possible) | SELECT trial suggested increased prostate cancer risk in healthy men taking 400 IU/day — findings controversial |
| All-cause mortality | Some meta-analyses suggest >400 IU/day associated with small increase in all-cause mortality — avoid supraphysiological doses without indication |
