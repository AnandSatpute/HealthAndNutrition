# Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)

## Overview
Vitamin B6 exists in six interconvertible forms: pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and their 5'-phosphate esters. The **biologically active coenzyme form** is **Pyridoxal-5'-Phosphate (PLP)**, which participates in over 100 enzyme reactions — predominantly in amino acid metabolism. Vitamin B6 has significance in neurotransmitter synthesis, immune function, haemoglobin production, and homocysteine regulation.

## Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 0.1 mg/day (AI) |
| Infants 7–12 months | 0.3 mg/day (AI) |
| Children 1–3 years | 0.5 mg/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 0.6 mg/day |
| Children 9–13 years | 1.0 mg/day |
| Adult Men 19–50 | 1.3 mg/day |
| Adult Men 51+ | 1.7 mg/day |
| Adult Women 19–50 | 1.3 mg/day |
| Adult Women 51+ | 1.5 mg/day |
| Pregnant Women | 1.9 mg/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 2.0 mg/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 100 mg/day for adults — exceeded primarily via supplementation.

## Functions
PLP acts as a coenzyme in a wide range of critical metabolic processes:
- **Amino Acid Metabolism:** Transamination, deamination, decarboxylation reactions for all amino acids.
- **Neurotransmitter Synthesis:**
  - Serotonin (from tryptophan)
  - Dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine (from tyrosine)
  - GABA (from glutamate)
  - Histamine (from histidine)
- **Haemoglobin Synthesis:** Required for delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase — the first step in porphyrin (haem) synthesis.
- **Glycogen Phosphorylase:** Required for glycogen breakdown to release glucose.
- **Homocysteine Regulation:** Cystathionine beta-synthase (PLP-dependent) converts homocysteine to cysteine.
- **Gene Expression:** PLP modulates steroid hormone receptor activity.
- **Immune Function:** Supports lymphocyte proliferation and IL-2 production.
- **Lipid Metabolism:** Participates in sphingolipid synthesis.

## Cofactors Needed
The conversion of dietary B6 to its active PLP form requires:

| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Riboflavin (B2)** | Required for pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase (key step in PLP synthesis) |
| **Magnesium** | Activates pyridoxal kinase; enhances PLP membrane transport |
| **Zinc** | Supports PLP-dependent enzyme function |
| **ATP** | Phosphorylation of pyridoxine/pyridoxal to phosphorylated coenzyme forms |

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Primarily in the jejunum via passive diffusion |
| **First-Pass Metabolism** | Converted to PLP in the liver and intestinal mucosa |
| **Distribution** | Liver (major storage), brain, muscles; PLP is ~90% protein-bound in plasma |
| **Half-Life (pyridoxine)** | 15–20 days |
| **Half-Life (PLP, active form)** | 36–95 hours |
| **Excretion** | Via urine as 4-pyridoxic acid (main metabolite) |

## Effects of Deficiency
Isolated B6 deficiency is rare but secondary deficiency due to medications is common.

**Symptoms:**
- Microcytic hypochromic anaemia (due to impaired haem synthesis)
- Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling)
- Pellagra-like dermatitis
- Glossitis, stomatitis
- Depression, confusion, irritability
- Impaired immune function
- Seizures (especially in infants — B6-dependency syndrome)

**At-Risk Groups:**
- Individuals taking isoniazid, hydralazine, penicillamine, oral contraceptives
- Patients with renal failure
- Alcohol use disorder
- Autoimmune conditions (IBD, rheumatoid arthritis)

## Treatment Protocols
| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Dietary deficiency | 50–100 mg/day oral for 1–2 weeks, then multivitamin with 2–5 mg/day |
| Drug-induced deficiency (e.g., isoniazid) | 10–50 mg/day prophylaxis; 100 mg/day therapeutic |
| B6-dependency seizures (infants) | 100 mg IV initially; may repeat up to 500 mg total |
| Premenstrual syndrome (modest evidence) | 50–100 mg/day |
| Pregnancy nausea/vomiting | 10–25 mg every 8 hours (often combined with doxylamine) |

## Drug Interactions
| Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| Isoniazid | Acts as a vitamin B6 antagonist; causes peripheral neuropathy |
| Hydralazine | Forms inactive complex with PLP |
| Penicillamine | Inactivates PLP |
| Cycloserine | Inhibits kynurenine aminotransferase (B6-dependent) |
| Corticosteroids | Increase B6 requirements |
| Levodopa (without carbidopa) | B6 accelerates peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine, reducing CNS efficacy |
| Oral contraceptives | Increase B6 requirements via altered tryptophan metabolism |
| Theophylline | May lower B6 levels |
| Altretamine/cisplatin chemotherapy | B6 co-administration may reduce their efficacy |

## Toxicity
Unique among water-soluble vitamins — B6 has a defined UL due to well-documented neurotoxicity.

| Dose | Risk |
|---|---|
| >500 mg/day (some reports at lower doses) | Sensory peripheral neuropathy |
| Chronic high dose | Progressive numbness, tingling, burning; loss of proprioception; ataxia |
| Recovery | Stop supplementation — recovery is slow (months to years); may be incomplete |

## Storage & Stability
- Sensitive to light (especially UV)
- Relatively heat-stable in neutral and acidic environments
- Water-soluble; leaches into cooking water
