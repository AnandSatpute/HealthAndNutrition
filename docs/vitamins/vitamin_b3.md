# Vitamin B3 (Niacin)

## Overview
Vitamin B3, commonly called **niacin**, is a water-soluble B vitamin that exists in three main forms:
- **Nicotinic acid** — dietary form; causes "niacin flush" at pharmacological doses
- **Nicotinamide (Niacinamide)** — preferred for supplementation; no flushing
- **Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)** — emerging form, a direct NAD+ precursor

Niacin can also be synthesized endogenously from the amino acid **tryptophan** (60 mg tryptophan → 1 mg niacin). Hence, requirements are expressed as **Niacin Equivalents (NE)**.

## Requirements (RDA)
Expressed in milligrams of **Niacin Equivalents (NE)**:

| Age / Group | RDA |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 2 mg NE/day (AI) |
| Infants 7–12 months | 4 mg NE/day (AI) |
| Children 1–3 years | 6 mg NE/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 8 mg NE/day |
| Children 9–13 years | 12 mg NE/day |
| Adult Men (19+) | 16 mg NE/day |
| Adult Women (19+) | 14 mg NE/day |
| Pregnant Women | 18 mg NE/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 17 mg NE/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 35 mg/day of niacin (as nicotinic acid or nicotinamide) for adults from all sources combined.

## Functions
Niacin's primary role is as precursor to the coenzymes **NAD** and **NADP**, which participate in >400 biochemical reactions:

- **Energy Metabolism:** NAD/NADH are central electron carriers in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and beta-oxidation.
- **Oxidative Phosphorylation:** NADH feeds electrons into Complex I of the mitochondrial ETC.
- **DNA Repair:** NAD⁺ is the substrate for PARP (poly-ADP-ribose polymerase) and sirtuins — DNA damage response enzymes.
- **Anabolic Pathways:** NADPH drives reductive biosynthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, and steroid hormones.
- **Antioxidant:** NADPH maintains reduced glutathione and is consumed by glutathione reductase.
- **Cellular Signalling:** NAD/NADP regulate sirtuins (longevity-associated deacetylases) and cADPR (calcium signalling).
- **Cardiovascular (pharmacological):** High-dose nicotinic acid raises HDL-C, lowers LDL-C and triglycerides.
- **Skin Health:** Protects against UV-induced DNA damage; reduces inflammatory conditions.
- **Neurological:** Neuroprotective; maintains brain energy metabolism via NAD+.

## Cofactors Needed
Niacin is itself converted to the coenzymes:
1. **NAD⁺ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide)** — oxidized form; accepts electrons
2. **NADH** — reduced form; donates electrons in ETC
3. **NADP⁺ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate)** — anabolic reactions
4. **NADPH** — reduced form; essential for reductive biosynthesis and antioxidant defence

> Riboflavin (B2) is needed for the tryptophan → niacin metabolic pathway.

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Facilitated diffusion; up to 90% for nicotinic acid, ~100% for nicotinamide |
| **Distribution** | ~20% plasma protein bound; adipose tissue, liver, kidneys |
| **First-pass metabolism** | Extensive and dose-dependent |
| **Plasma Half-Life** | 20–45 minutes (nicotinic acid) |
| **Metabolite Half-Lives** | Nicotinuric acid: 1.3 h; N-methylnicotinamide: 12.6 h |
| **Excretion** | 60–76% in urine; up to 12% excreted unchanged |

## Effects of Deficiency (Pellagra)
Severe deficiency causes **pellagra**, the disease of the "4 Ds":

| Symptom | Details |
|---|---|
| **Dermatitis** | Dark pigmented rash on sun-exposed skin ("Casal's necklace"); photosensitive |
| **Diarrhoea** | Often bloody; GI mucosal atrophy |
| **Dementia** | Headache, fatigue, memory loss, disorientation, hallucinations; psychosis |
| **Death** | If untreated |

Other symptoms: glossitis (bright red tongue), stomatitis, vomiting, constipation.

**Causes:** Maize-dominated diets without nixtamalization (niacin is bound), alcoholism, carcinoid syndrome (tryptophan diverted), Hartnup disease (tryptophan malabsorption), isoniazid therapy.

---

## Treatment Protocols
| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Pellagra (WHO recommendation) | 300 mg/day nicotinamide orally in divided doses, or 100 mg/day parenterally for 3–4 weeks |
| Dietary deficiency | Nicotinamide 50–100 mg/day + balanced diet |
| Dyslipidemia (pharmacological) | Nicotinic acid 1–3 g/day (extended release); medical supervision required |
| Migraine prevention (limited evidence) | 400–500 mg/day |

> Nicotinamide is preferred for deficiency treatment — it corrects the deficiency without causing flushing.

## Drug Interactions
| Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| Statins | Combined use increases muscle damage risk (myopathy/rhabdomyolysis) |
| Anticoagulants (Warfarin) | Niacin may impair clotting → increased bleeding risk |
| Blood pressure medications | Niacin lowers BP; additive hypotension risk |
| Diabetes medications | Niacin raises blood glucose; may require dose adjustment |
| Allopurinol | Niacin raises uric acid → worsens gout |
| Alcohol | Increases flushing; raises risk of hepatotoxicity |
| Aspirin (low-dose) | Reduces niacin flush; high-dose may slow niacin clearance |
| Zinc | Worsens flushing and itching |
| Chromium | May lower blood glucose additively |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Niacin (mg NE) |
|---|---|---|
| Beef liver (cooked) | 85g | ~14.7 mg |
| Chicken breast (cooked) | 85g | ~11.8 mg |
| Tuna (canned in water) | 85g | ~11.3 mg |
| Pork loin (cooked) | 85g | ~6.6 mg |
| Fortified breakfast cereal | 1 cup | 5–27 mg |
| Salmon (cooked) | 85g | ~8.6 mg |
| Peanuts (dry roasted) | 28g | ~4.2 mg |
| Brown rice (cooked) | 195g | ~3.0 mg |
| Mushrooms (cooked) | 86g | ~3.8 mg |

> **Note:** Corn's niacin is largely in a bound (niacytin) form unavailable to the body unless treated with alkali — the process of nixtamalization (used in traditional tortilla-making) releases the niacin.

## Toxicity
| Type | Threshold | Symptoms |
|---|---|---|
| Niacin Flush | ≥30 mg nicotinic acid | Flushing, warmth, pruritus (face/neck) — harmless but uncomfortable |
| GI Toxicity | >1 g/day | Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, peptic ulcers |
| Hepatotoxicity | >2–6 g/day (especially sustained-release) | Elevated liver enzymes → liver failure (rare) |
| Hyperglycaemia | >1 g/day | Impaired insulin sensitivity |
| Hyperuricaemia | >1 g/day | Can precipitate gout attacks |
| Hypotension | Any dose | Rapid heart rate, dizziness |

## Storage & Stability
- Relatively stable to heat and light compared to other B vitamins
- Water-soluble; can leach into cooking water
- Nicotinamide is more stable than nicotinic acid in solution
