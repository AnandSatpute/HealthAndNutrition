# Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)

## Overview
Vitamin B5, known as **pantothenic acid** (from Greek "pantos" = "everywhere"), is a water-soluble B vitamin found in virtually all foods. It is the precursor to **Coenzyme A (CoA)** — one of the most central molecules in metabolism, involved in over 70 enzymatic reactions. Despite its ubiquity, it is often overlooked in nutritional science due to the rarity of isolated deficiency.

## Requirements (RDA)
No formal RDA has been established for pantothenic acid due to insufficient evidence. An **Adequate Intake (AI)** is used instead:

| Age / Group | AI |
|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | 1.7 mg/day |
| Infants 7–12 months | 1.8 mg/day |
| Children 1–3 years | 2 mg/day |
| Children 4–8 years | 3 mg/day |
| Children 9–13 years | 4 mg/day |
| Adolescents 14–18 years | 5 mg/day |
| Adults (19+) | 5 mg/day |
| Pregnant Women | 6 mg/day |
| Breastfeeding Women | 7 mg/day |

> **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** None established — no adverse effects reported from high oral intakes.

## Functions
- **Coenzyme A (CoA) Synthesis:** Primary function — CoA is essential for:
  - Acetyl-CoA production (central to citric acid cycle and ATP generation)
  - Fatty acid synthesis and beta-oxidation
  - Amino acid catabolism
  - Synthesis of steroid hormones, bile acids, and heme
  - Acetylation reactions (e.g., acetylation of histones and proteins)
- **Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP):** Pantothenic acid is also a component of ACP, critical for de novo fatty acid synthesis.
- **Neurotransmitter Synthesis:** Acetyl-CoA is needed for synthesis of acetylcholine.
- **Gluconeogenesis:** CoA participates in conversion of non-carbohydrate precursors to glucose.
- **Adrenal Function:** High CoA concentrations in adrenal glands support steroid hormone synthesis.
- **Skin, Hair, Nails:** Supports epithelial integrity via fatty acid synthesis.
- **Immune Function:** Supports production of antibodies and immune cell proliferation.
- **Stress Response:** Involved in synthesis of cortisol (a stress hormone).

## Cofactors Needed
Pantothenic acid is the precursor; its active forms are:

1. **Coenzyme A (CoA)** — synthesised in a 5-step pathway from pantothenic acid
2. **Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP)** — the phosphopantetheine group from CoA is transferred to an acyl carrier protein

The CoA synthesis pathway requires:
| Cofactor | Role |
|---|---|
| **ATP** | Required for phosphorylation steps |
| **Cysteine** | Incorporated during pantothenate kinase step |
| **Vitamin C** | Indirectly supports CoA-dependent enzyme reactions |

## Pharmacokinetics

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Dietary CoA/phosphopantetheine hydrolysed to free pantothenate in gut; absorbed via sodium-dependent active transport (saturable) + passive diffusion at high doses |
| **Bioavailability** | 40–61% from dietary sources |
| **Peak Concentration** | ~1 hour after ingestion (fasted); delayed ~2 hours when taken with food |
| **Distribution** | Liver (highest), adrenal glands, kidneys, brain, heart, testes |
| **Metabolism** | Incorporated into CoA and ACP within tissues |
| **Terminal Half-Life** | ~225 hours (based on calcium pantothenate studies) |
| **Steady State** | Achieved ~day 14 with multiple daily doses |
| **Excretion** | Excreted intact in urine; amount proportional to intake |

## Effects of Deficiency
Pantothenic acid deficiency is extremely rare in free-living individuals due to its presence in virtually all foods. Isolated deficiency typically only occurs in severe malnutrition or specific genetic conditions.

**Symptoms of Deficiency:**
- Fatigue and weakness
- GI disturbances: nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps
- Neurological: burning feet syndrome (paraesthesia), irritability, sleep disturbances, restlessness
- Headache, impaired coordination

**"Burning Feet Syndrome":** A well-documented symptom during periods of wartime deprivation — painful paresthesia in feet believed to involve pantothenic acid deficiency.

**At-Risk Groups:**
- Severely malnourished individuals
- Patients with inherited pantothenate kinase deficiency (PANK2 mutations → neurodegeneration)
- Patients on total parenteral nutrition without supplementation

## Treatment Protocols
| Condition | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Mild deficiency | 5–10 mg/day oral pantothenic acid |
| Severe deficiency / malnutrition | Higher doses; IV supplementation as part of multi-vitamin preparation |
| Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration | Specialised care; pantothenate supplementation under investigation |

> **Note:** No high-dose therapeutic use has been established for pantothenic acid in the way that exists for other B vitamins.

## Drug Interactions
Interactions are rare. However:
| Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| Oral contraceptives | May increase pantothenic acid requirements |
| Antibiotics (prolonged use) | May alter gut flora and reduce intestinal pantothenate production |
| Salicylates (aspirin, high dose) | May interfere with pantothenic acid utilisation |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Pantothenic Acid (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Beef liver (cooked) | 85g | ~5.9 mg |
| Sunflower seeds | 28g | ~2.0 mg |
| Chicken breast (cooked) | 85g | ~1.3 mg |
| Avocado | ½ fruit | ~1.0 mg |
| Portobello mushroom (cooked) | 86g | ~1.5 mg |
| Sweet potato (cooked) | 1 medium | ~1.0 mg |
| Fortified cereal | 1 cup | 5 mg (variable) |
| Milk (whole) | 240 ml | ~0.9 mg |
| Egg (whole) | 1 large | ~0.7 mg |

> **Stability note:** Food processing (canning, refrigerating, freezing, and grain refining) can destroy 20–80% of pantothenic acid content.

## Storage & Stability
- Susceptible to heat — significant losses in boiling and canning
- Water-soluble; leaches into cooking liquid
- Relatively stable at neutral pH but degraded in acidic and alkaline conditions
- Protect supplements from moisture and light

## Toxicity
No known toxicity from oral intake. Very high doses (e.g., 10–20 g/day) may occasionally cause mild GI upset or diarrhoea. No Tolerable Upper Intake Level has been set.
