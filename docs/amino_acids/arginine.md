# Arginine

## Overview
Arginine is a **conditionally essential amino acid** — it is synthesised endogenously from citrulline (via the urea cycle) in adults, but synthesis is insufficient during periods of rapid growth, critical illness, injury, or metabolic stress. Arginine is the direct precursor of **nitric oxide (NO)** — the principal mediator of vascular tone, immune killing, and cell signalling. It is also a central component of the **urea cycle** and a precursor of **creatine**, **polyamines**, and **proline**.

- **Classification:** Conditionally essential
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Arg / R
- **Side chain:** Guanidinium group; strongly basic (pKa ~12.5); always positively charged at physiological pH
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Glucogenic (→ α-ketoglutarate via ornithine → glutamate pathway)

## Dietary Requirements

| Age / Group | Estimated need |
|---|---|
| Infants | 161 mg/kg/day (essential at this age) |
| Adults (endogenous synthesis adequate) | ~5–6 g/day from mixed diet typical |
| Critical illness / wound healing | Greatly increased; supplemental doses 15–30 g/day studied |

> No established RDA or UL from food for adults under normal conditions. Preterm infants cannot synthesise sufficient arginine — considered essential in this group.

## Functions

- **Nitric Oxide (NO) Synthesis:** Arg + O₂ → **NO + Citrulline** (by nitric oxide synthase; NOS1/nNOS, NOS2/iNOS, NOS3/eNOS; requires BH4, NADPH, FAD, FMN, calmodulin)
  - eNOS (endothelial): vasodilation, inhibits platelet aggregation, anti-atherosclerotic
  - nNOS (neuronal): neurotransmission, learning and memory
  - iNOS (inducible, macrophages): high-output NO for microbial killing (bactericidal, tumoricidal)
- **Urea Cycle:** Arginine → ornithine + urea (arginase) — the final, essential step in ammonia detoxification; ornithine then regenerates citrulline to sustain the cycle
- **Creatine Synthesis:** Arginine + Glycine → Guanidinoacetate (in kidney) → Creatine (SAM methylation in liver); creatine phosphate is the primary rapid-energy buffer in muscle
- **Polyamine Synthesis:** Ornithine → Putrescine → Spermidine → Spermine (polyamines; essential for cell proliferation, DNA stability, and apoptosis regulation)
- **Proline Synthesis:** Ornithine → proline (for collagen synthesis)
- **Growth Hormone Secretion:** Arginine stimulates pituitary GH release (by inhibiting somatostatin); used as a GH stimulation test
- **Immune Function:** iNOS-derived NO is a critical antimicrobial and antitumour effector; arginine availability governs macrophage killing capacity

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Endogenous synthesis** | Citrulline (from intestinal enterocytes; glutamine/proline origin) → Arginine (kidney, via ASS + ASL enzymes) |
| **Urea cycle** | Carbamoyl phosphate + Ornithine → Citrulline → Argininosuccinate → Arginine → Ornithine + Urea |
| **NO production** | Arg → NO + Citrulline (NOS isoforms) |
| **Creatine** | Arg + Gly → guanidinoacetate (AGAT) → creatine (GAMT + SAM) |
| **Key enzymes** | Arginase (Arg → Orn + Urea); NOS isoforms; AGAT; argininosuccinate synthase (ASS); lyase (ASL) |

## Clinical Relevance

### Urea Cycle Disorders
- Defects in urea cycle enzymes (OTC, CPS1, ASS — citrullinaemia, ASL — argininosuccinic aciduria, ARG — hyperargininaemia)
- Results in hyperammonaemia — encephalopathy, liver disease, developmental delay
- Arginine is supplemented in most urea cycle disorders (except ARG deficiency) to maintain urea cycle flux
- Treatment: low-protein diet, nitrogen scavengers (sodium benzoate, sodium phenylacetate), arginine supplementation, liver transplant

### Citrullinaemia Type I (ASS Deficiency)
- Inability to convert citrulline → argininosuccinate → arginine; accumulates citrulline and ammonia
- Treated with arginine supplementation (bypasses the defect by providing arginine directly)

### Sepsis and Critical Illness
- NO-mediated vasodilation is pathological in septic shock (iNOS-generated NO causes uncontrolled vasodilation)
- Arginine supplementation in critically ill patients is controversial — may be harmful in septic shock (worsens vasodilation) but beneficial post-surgery (immune nutrition formulations)

### Cardiovascular Disease
- Arginine → eNOS → NO → vasodilation → reduced blood pressure, reduced platelet aggregation, reduced LDL oxidation
- Arginine supplementation trials show modest BP reduction; conflicting CVD mortality data
- L-Arginine supplementation post-MI showed increased mortality in one trial (VINTAGE MI) — caution in acute MI

### Lysine-Arginine Competition (Herpes Simplex)
- HSV requires arginine for replication; high lysine intake competes with arginine at shared transporters → reduced intracellular arginine → inhibits viral replication (see Lysine note)

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **BH4 (Tetrahydrobiopterin)** | Essential NOS cofactor; BH4 deficiency → uncoupled NOS → superoxide instead of NO (oxidative stress) |
| **Lysine** | Competitive intestinal uptake (shared cationic transporter); high lysine lowers arginine availability |
| **Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)** | Endogenous NOS inhibitor; elevated in CKD, hypertension, diabetes — blocks NO from arginine |
| **Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (sildenafil)** | Work downstream of NO (prevent cGMP breakdown); arginine → NO → cGMP → vasodilation — synergistic effect; risk of hypotension if combined with arginine supplements |
| **Creatine** | Arginine spares creatine synthesis need — high dietary creatine reduces arginine use for AGAT reaction |

## Supplementation Notes
- **L-Arginine (2–6 g/day):** Used for erectile dysfunction (limited evidence), hypertension (modest effect), exercise performance (via NO-mediated muscle blood flow)
- **Arginine + Citrulline:** Citrulline often preferred — better oral bioavailability, fewer GI side effects, and effectively raises plasma arginine more than arginine itself (bypasses first-pass intestinal arginase)
- **Immune nutrition (perioperative immunonutrition):** Enteral formulas enriched with arginine, glutamine, omega-3 FAs — evidence supports better surgical outcomes in elective major surgery; controversial in sepsis
- **Growth Hormone testing:** IV arginine infusion (0.5 g/kg over 30 min) — standard GH stimulation test
- **Avoid in:** Septic shock (worsens vasodilation), herpes simplex outbreaks (arginine promotes HSV replication)
