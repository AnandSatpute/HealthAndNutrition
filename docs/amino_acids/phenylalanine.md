# Phenylalanine

## Overview
Phenylalanine is an **essential amino acid** and the metabolic precursor of **tyrosine**, **dopamine**, **norepinephrine**, **epinephrine**, **melanin**, and **thyroid hormones**. Its conversion to tyrosine by **phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH)** is the most clinically significant reaction, and deficiency of PAH causes the well-known inborn error **phenylketonuria (PKU)**. Phenylalanine exists as two enantiomers: L-phenylalanine (proteinogenic) and D-phenylalanine (inhibits enkephalin degradation).

- **Classification:** Essential (9 essential amino acids)
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Phe / F
- **Side chain:** Benzyl group (phenyl + methylene); large, hydrophobic, aromatic
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Both (glucogenic via fumarate; ketogenic via acetoacetate)

## Dietary Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA (combined Phe + Tyr, mg/kg/day) | Approximate daily need |
|---|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | ~98 mg/kg/day | — |
| Children 1–3 years | ~69 mg/kg/day | ~1,500 mg/day |
| Adults 19+ | ~33 mg/kg/day | ~2,300 mg/day (70 kg adult) |

> RDA is expressed as combined phenylalanine + tyrosine (since Phe → Tyr via PAH). Individuals with PKU must restrict Phe drastically and supplement with tyrosine.

## Functions

- **Tyrosine Synthesis:** PAH + tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) → hydroxylates Phe → Tyr; this is the rate-limiting step for catecholamine and thyroid hormone production
- **Catecholamine Precursor Chain:** Phe → Tyr → L-DOPA → Dopamine → Norepinephrine → Epinephrine
- **Melanin Synthesis:** Phe → Tyr → DOPA → eumelanin / pheomelanin (via tyrosinase)
- **Thyroid Hormone Precursor:** Tyr residues in thyroglobulin are iodinated → T3/T4 (requires PAH-generated tyrosine)
- **Protein Structure:** Aromatic side chain participates in hydrophobic core packing, π-stacking, and cation-π interactions in protein folding
- **Aspartame Metabolism:** Aspartame (artificial sweetener) = Asp + Phe methyl ester; hydrolysis releases phenylalanine — critical PKU warning on all aspartame-containing products
- **Enkephalin Degradation Inhibition (D-Phe):** D-phenylalanine inhibits carboxypeptidase A and enkephalinase → prolongs endogenous opioid (enkephalin) activity — used in some analgesic formulations as DL-phenylalanine (DLPA)

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Active transport via LAT1 (SLC7A5); same transporter as BCAAs and tyrosine |
| **Hydroxylation** | Phe + O₂ + BH4 → Tyr + BH2 (phenylalanine hydroxylase, PAH; liver) |
| **BH4 regeneration** | DHPR enzyme (dihydropteridine reductase); requires NADH |
| **Catabolism** | Tyr → 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate → homogentisate → maleylacetoacetate → fumarate + acetoacetate |
| **Aromatic metabolites** | Phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate (PKU markers); trace amounts in normal catabolism |

## Clinical Relevance

### Phenylketonuria (PKU)
- **Cause:** Autosomal recessive deficiency of **PAH** (or its cofactor BH4) → phenylalanine accumulates
- **Classic PKU:** PAH activity <1%; plasma Phe > 1,200 μmol/L
- **Pathophysiology:** Excess Phe competes with LAT1 for transport across the blood-brain barrier → reduces brain aromatic amino acids → decreased dopamine, serotonin, myelin synthesis → intellectual disability, seizures, musty odour (phenylacetate), eczema, fair skin/hair (reduced melanin)
- **Newborn Screening:** Universal in most countries (Guthrie test / tandem MS); treatment must begin within 3 weeks of birth to prevent irreversible neurological damage
- **Treatment:**
  - Phe-restricted diet with amino acid formula (Phe-free) + supplemental tyrosine (lifelong)
  - **Sapropterin (Kuvan):** Synthetic BH4; works in BH4-responsive PKU variants (~25–50% of patients) — lowers plasma Phe levels
  - **Pegvaliase (Palynziq):** PEGylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (bacterial enzyme) — metabolises Phe to ammonia + trans-cinnamic acid; for adults with uncontrolled PKU
  - **Maternal PKU:** Women with PKU must maintain Phe <360 μmol/L throughout pregnancy to prevent embryopathy

### BH4 Deficiencies (Non-classic Hyperphenylalaninaemia)
- Defects in BH4 synthesis/recycling (DHPR, PTPS, GCH1 deficiencies) → neurotransmitter deficiencies despite near-normal Phe levels (since BH4 is also cofactor for tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases)
- Treated with BH4 + neurotransmitter precursors (L-DOPA, 5-HTP)

### Alkaptonuria
- Deficiency of **homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase** (downstream in phenylalanine/tyrosine catabolism)
- Accumulation of homogentisic acid → excreted in urine (darkens on standing), deposited in connective tissue (ochronosis) → arthritis, darkened sclerae and ear cartilage

### Albinism (Oculocutaneous)
- Tyrosinase deficiency → impaired melanin synthesis from Tyr (Phe/Tyr pathway intact; block is downstream)

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)** | Essential PAH cofactor; riboflavin and NADH maintain BH4 in active form |
| **Tyrosine** | Product of Phe hydroxylation — spares Phe requirements; supplemented in PKU to prevent catecholamine deficiency |
| **LAT1 transporter competitors** | BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, valine) share LAT1 — very high BCAA intake reduces Phe/Tyr brain transport (used experimentally to lower Phe in brain in PKU) |
| **Aspartame** | Releases Phe on hydrolysis — all aspartame products carry PKU warning |
| **MAOIs** | Block monoamine oxidase — excess tyramine/phenylalanine can cause hypertensive crisis with certain foods; Phe relevance is indirect via tyrosine/tyramine |

## Supplementation Notes
- **DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA):** Combination of L- and D-enantiomers; marketed for pain relief (D-form inhibits enkephalin degradation) and mood support — limited clinical evidence; avoid in PKU
- **L-Phenylalanine:** Rarely supplemented alone; used in some vitiligo protocols (with UVA therapy) to increase melanin synthesis
- **Contraindicated in PKU** — any phenylalanine supplement is dangerous for PKU patients
- Excess phenylalanine suppresses tryptophan and tyrosine brain uptake via LAT1 competition — relevant at very high supplement doses
