# Leucine

## Overview
Leucine is an **essential amino acid** and the most abundant branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) by proportion in muscle protein. It is the primary nutritional signal that activates **mTORC1** (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1), making it the key anabolic trigger for muscle protein synthesis. Unlike other amino acids, leucine is catabolised primarily in **skeletal muscle** (not the liver), making its plasma level an important metabolic signal in the postprandial state.

- **Classification:** Essential; Branched-Chain Amino Acid (BCAA)
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Leu / L
- **Side chain:** Isobutyl (aliphatic, hydrophobic)
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Exclusively **ketogenic** (→ acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate; does not contribute to gluconeogenesis)

## Dietary Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA (mg/kg/day) | Approximate daily need |
|---|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | ~103 mg/kg/day | — |
| Children 1–3 years | ~73 mg/kg/day | ~1,600 mg/day |
| Adults 19+ | ~39 mg/kg/day | ~2,730 mg/day (70 kg adult) |
| Athletes / high protein need | Higher | 3,000–4,000 mg/day |

> No established UL from food sources. Leucine supplements at very high doses (>10 g/day) may impair isoleucine and valine status and cause mild hyperammonaemia.

## Functions

- **mTORC1 Activation (Master Anabolic Signal):** Leucine directly activates mTORC1 via the Rag GTPase–Ragulator complex and Sestrin2 sensor — initiates protein synthesis through phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1. No other amino acid has this potency.
- **Muscle Protein Synthesis:** Acts as both a substrate and regulatory signal; the "leucine threshold" concept — a minimum intracellular leucine concentration must be reached to maximally stimulate MPS.
- **Insulin Secretion:** Stimulates pancreatic β-cell insulin secretion independently of glucose (via glutamate dehydrogenase activation).
- **Protein Sparing:** During energy restriction, leucine catabolism can generate ketone bodies and acetyl-CoA for energy substrate.
- **Wound Healing:** Provides substrate for tissue repair; upregulates protein synthesis in recovering tissues.
- **Glucose Homeostasis:** High leucine activates mTORC1 → S6K1 → IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, which can impair insulin signalling at high doses (mechanistic link between high BCAA diets and insulin resistance).

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Transported by LAT1 (SLC7A5) — shared with other BCAAs, tyrosine, phenylalanine |
| **First-pass metabolism** | Minimal hepatic extraction (~5%); primarily taken up by muscle |
| **Catabolism** | Leucine → α-ketoisocaproate (KIC) via BCAA aminotransferase → isovaleryl-CoA → acetyl-CoA + acetoacetate (via BCKD complex) |
| **Key enzyme** | Branched-Chain α-Keto Acid Dehydrogenase (BCKD) — requires B1, B2, B3, lipoic acid |
| **Regulation** | BCKD is inactivated by phosphorylation; activated by dephosphorylation in muscle with exercise |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Leucine (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Beef (lean, cooked) | 85g | ~2,150 mg |
| Chicken breast (cooked) | 85g | ~2,090 mg |
| Canned tuna | 85g | ~1,900 mg |
| Milk (whole) | 240 mL | ~800 mg |
| Whey protein isolate | 30g | ~2,900 mg |
| Lentils (cooked) | 200g | ~1,300 mg |
| Edamame (cooked) | 155g | ~1,200 mg |
| Parmesan cheese | 28g | ~870 mg |

> Whey protein is notably leucine-rich (~10–11%) and rapidly absorbed, making it particularly effective for MPS stimulation.

## Clinical Relevance

### Leucinosis / Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD)
- Autosomal recessive deficiency of the **BCKD complex** — all three BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, valine) accumulate
- Leucine is the primary neurotoxin — causes encephalopathy, cerebral oedema
- Classic MSUD: neonatal onset; characteristic maple syrup odour in urine/cerumen
- Management: BCAA-restricted diet; leucine-reduced medical formulas; liver transplant (curative — restores hepatic BCKD activity)

### Sarcopenia & Ageing
- Anabolic resistance — older muscle requires higher leucine doses to maximally activate MPS
- Leucine-enriched protein supplements (leucine ≥ 3g per meal) may partially overcome anabolic resistance in elderly

### Hyperleucinaemia and Insulin Resistance
- Chronically elevated plasma BCAA (incl. leucine) — strong biomarker associated with insulin resistance and T2DM risk
- Mechanistic: S6K1 → IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation → impairs insulin signalling

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Isoleucine + Valine** | BCAAs compete for the same transporter (LAT1); excess leucine can lower plasma isoleucine and valine — BCAA supplements should contain balanced ratios (typically 2:1:1 Leu:Ile:Val) |
| **B vitamins (B1, B2, B3, lipoic acid)** | Cofactors for the BCKD complex — deficiency slows leucine catabolism |
| **Insulin** | Leucine stimulates insulin; insulin drives leucine into muscle — synergistic for post-meal anabolism |
| **Rapamycin / mTOR inhibitors** | Block leucine's anabolic signalling — clinically relevant in transplant and oncology patients |

## Supplementation Notes
- **BCAA supplements:** Most commonly 2:1:1 (Leu:Ile:Val) ratio; used peri-workout to limit muscle catabolism
- **Leucine-enriched protein meals:** Effective strategy for elderly or those with anabolic resistance
- **HMB (β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate):** Metabolite of leucine (via KIC); marketed for anti-catabolic effects — evidence is stronger in untrained individuals and clinical muscle-wasting states
- Isolated high-dose leucine (>10–15 g/day chronically) is not advised due to aminoaciduria and potential metabolic imbalances
