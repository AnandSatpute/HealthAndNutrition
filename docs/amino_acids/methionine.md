# Methionine

## Overview
Methionine is an **essential amino acid** and the only sulphur-containing essential amino acid (alongside the conditionally essential cysteine). It is the universal methyl group donor via its activated form **S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)**, making it central to epigenetic regulation, neurotransmitter inactivation, creatine synthesis, and the **transsulphuration pathway** that produces cysteine and ultimately glutathione. All mammalian protein synthesis begins with methionine (start codon: AUG).

- **Classification:** Essential (9 essential amino acids)
- **IUPAC abbreviation:** Met / M
- **Side chain:** Thioether (–CH₂–CH₂–S–CH₃); sulphur-containing, hydrophobic
- **Glucogenic / Ketogenic:** Glucogenic (→ succinyl-CoA via propionate)

## Dietary Requirements (RDA)

| Age / Group | RDA (combined Met + Cys, mg/kg/day) | Approximate daily need |
|---|---|---|
| Infants 0–6 months | ~43 mg/kg/day | — |
| Children 1–3 years | ~28 mg/kg/day | ~615 mg/day |
| Adults 19+ | ~19 mg/kg/day | ~1,330 mg/day (70 kg adult) |

> RDA is expressed as combined methionine + cysteine (cysteine can spare methionine). No established UL from food. High supplemental methionine (>5 g/day) increases plasma homocysteine significantly.

## Functions

- **S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) — Universal Methyl Donor:**
  - Methionine + ATP → SAM (via methionine adenosyltransferase)
  - SAM donates methyl groups to DNA (DNA methylation → gene silencing), histones, RNA, neurotransmitters, phospholipids, creatine, and dozens of other substrates
  - SAM → S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) → homocysteine → re-methylated to methionine (requires folate, B12) or directed to transsulphuration
- **Methionine Cycle (One-Carbon Metabolism):**
  - Remethylation: Homocysteine + 5-methylTHF → Methionine (requires B12 as cofactor for methionine synthase)
  - Transsulphuration: Homocysteine → Cystathionine (CBS, B6-dependent) → Cysteine → Glutathione, taurine, sulphate
- **Initiation of Protein Synthesis:** All eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from AUG (methionine) start codon; the initiator Met is frequently co-translationally cleaved
- **Creatine Synthesis:** SAM donates a methyl group in guanidinoacetate → creatine conversion (in liver); creatine synthesis consumes ~40–45% of daily SAM methyl groups
- **Phosphatidylcholine Synthesis:** SAM methylates phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) → phosphatidylcholine (PC) — critical for cell membrane function and VLDL secretion from liver
- **Epigenetic Regulation:** DNA methylation (by DNMTs using SAM) controls gene expression across development, ageing, and disease
- **Antioxidant Precursor:** Via transsulphuration → Cysteine → Glutathione (GSH), taurine

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Absorption** | Active transport (intestinal – SLC7A9, SLC6A19) |
| **Activation** | Met + ATP → SAM (methionine adenosyltransferase, MAT1A/MAT2A) |
| **Methylation** | SAM → SAH → Homocysteine |
| **Remethylation** | Hcy + 5-MTHF → Met (methionine synthase; B12-dependent) |
| **Transsulphuration** | Hcy → cystathionine (CBS; B6) → Cysteine |
| **Catabolism** | Cysteine → pyruvate / sulphate / taurine; Met → α-ketobutyrate → propionyl-CoA → succinyl-CoA |

## Food Sources

| Food | Serving | Methionine (mg) |
|---|---|---|
| Beef (lean, cooked) | 85g | ~680 mg |
| Chicken breast (cooked) | 85g | ~650 mg |
| Canned tuna | 85g | ~700 mg |
| Egg | 1 large | ~210 mg |
| Brazil nuts | 28g | ~640 mg |
| Parmesan cheese | 28g | ~490 mg |
| Lentils (cooked) | 200g | ~310 mg |
| Sesame seeds | 28g | ~335 mg |

> Animal proteins are consistently high in methionine. Plant proteins (particularly legumes) tend to be **methionine-limited** (complemented by cereals which are methionine-rich but lysine-poor).

## Clinical Relevance

### Homocystinuria (Classical)
- Deficiency of **cystathionine β-synthase (CBS)**; autosomal recessive
- Homocysteine accumulates to very high levels (plasma Hcy >100 μmol/L)
- Features: Marfanoid habitus, ectopia lentis (downward lens dislocation — opposite of Marfan), intellectual disability, osteoporosis, thromboembolic events (DVT, stroke)
- Treatment: B6 (many are pyridoxine-responsive), methionine-restricted + cystine-supplemented diet, betaine (alternative methyl donor for remethylation), folate + B12

### Hyperhomocysteinaemia
- Mild-moderate elevation (15–100 μmol/L): B12, folate, B6 deficiency; CKD; hypothyroidism; MTHFR C677T polymorphism
- Independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, dementia
- Treatment: B12 + folate (± B6) supplementation lowers Hcy levels; evidence for CVD risk reduction is mixed

### Methionine Restriction (Longevity Research)
- Dietary methionine restriction extends lifespan in rodents — mechanism: reduced IGF-1, reduced mitochondrial ROS generation, altered methionine cycle flux
- Human relevance under investigation; not a current clinical recommendation

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Drug | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Folate (B9) + B12** | Required for remethylation of homocysteine → methionine; deficiency causes Hcy accumulation |
| **Pyridoxine (B6)** | CBS cofactor for transsulphuration; deficiency causes homocystinuria (partially reversible with B6) |
| **Riboflavin (B2)** | Cofactor for MTHFR (converts dietary folate to 5-MTHF); relevant especially with MTHFR C677T |
| **Cysteine** | Cysteine can spare methionine requirements by reducing the transsulphuration demand |
| **Betaine** | Alternative methyl donor remethylating homocysteine (BHMT pathway); used in homocystinuria management |
| **Nitrous oxide (N₂O)** | Irreversibly inactivates B12 → blocks methionine synthase → acute functional methionine cycle impairment |

## Supplementation Notes
- **SAMe (S-adenosylmethionine) supplements:** Used for depression, osteoarthritis, liver disease; effective SAM precursor; doses 400–1,600 mg/day
- **Methionine supplementation is rarely needed** in individuals with adequate dietary protein
- High-protein diets elevate methionine intake and can raise homocysteine — especially relevant if B vitamin status is suboptimal
- **NAC (N-acetylcysteine)** provides cysteine, which can reduce the methionine burden on the transsulphuration pathway
