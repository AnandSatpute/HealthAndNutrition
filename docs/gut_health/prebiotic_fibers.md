# Prebiotic Fibers: Inulin, FOS & Pectin

## Overview
Prebiotics are selectively fermented dietary components that confer a health benefit on the host through modulation of the gut microbiota composition and/or activity. The term was formally defined by Gibson & Roberfroid (1995) and updated by the ISAPP (2017) to encompass non-digestible compounds beyond just fibre. The three major prebiotic fibers covered here — **Inulin**, **Fructooligosaccharides (FOS)**, and **Pectin** — are the best-characterised and most clinically studied. All three resist digestion in the small intestine and are fermented in the colon, but they differ substantially in structure, fermentation kinetics, and microbiome effects.

- **Classification:** Non-digestible dietary fibers (soluble fiber category)
- **Shared mechanism:** Escape small intestine absorption → reach colon intact → fermented by specific bacteria → produce SCFAs and other metabolites → confer health benefits
- **Key fermentation products:** Butyrate, propionate, acetate (short-chain fatty acids)
- **Selectivity criteria (ISAPP):** Must selectively stimulate specific beneficial bacteria (not all colonic bacteria equally)

## Inulin

### Structure and Sources
Inulin is a polysaccharide composed of **fructose chains** (β-1,2 linkages) terminated by a glucose residue; chain length (degree of polymerisation, DP) ranges from DP 2 to >60. It is extracted primarily from **chicory root** (the main commercial source, 41–48% of dry weight). Inulin-type fructans are also found in Jerusalem artichoke, dahlia tubers, globe artichoke, garlic, leek, onion, asparagus, and banana.

| Property | Details |
|---|---|
| **Chain length** | Long-chain inulin: DP 10–60 + (slower fermentation, more distal colon) |
| **Fermentation rate** | Slower than FOS → ferments more distally → more even butyrate distribution across colon |
| **Bifidogenic effect** | Strongly and selectively stimulates *Bifidobacterium* and *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii* |
| **Commercial forms** | Orafti HP, Fibersol-2; widely used in functional food industry |
| **Caloric value** | ~1.5 kcal/g (vs. 4 kcal/g for digestible carbohydrates) — useful in calorie-reduced products |

### Health Effects
- **Laxation:** Increases stool frequency and bulk; evidence stronger than for short-chain FOS at equal doses
- **Calcium absorption:** Long-chain inulin (8–15 g/day) significantly enhances colonic calcium absorption — meta-analysis confirms 20% increase in Ca absorption; relevant for bone health
- **Lipid metabolism:** Modest reductions in fasting TG and total cholesterol in RCTs with doses ≥10 g/day; likely via propionate-mediated hepatic lipogenesis inhibition
- **Glucose control:** Reduces postprandial glucose (GLP-1 secretion via L-cell stimulation); modest effect at 8–15 g/day

## Fructooligosaccharides (FOS / Oligofructose)

### Structure and Sources
FOS are short-chain inulin-type fructans with **DP 2–8** (most commonly DP 3–5). **Oligofructose** refers to the inulin fraction with DP 2–8 produced by partial enzymatic hydrolysis of inulin. FOS can also be synthesised from sucrose using fructosyltransferases. Found naturally in: onion (~2–6% fw), leek, asparagus, garlic, artichoke, banana; chicory root produces both inulin and FOS.

| Property | Details |
|---|---|
| **Chain length** | Short (DP 2–8) → rapid fermentation, primarily in proximal colon |
| **Fermentation rate** | Fast → significant gas production (H₂, CO₂) → flatulence and bloating dose-dependently |
| **Bifidogenic effect** | Potent *Bifidobacterium* and *Lactobacillus* stimulator; classic "prebiotic substrate" |
| **Sweetness** | ~30–50% sweetness of sucrose → used as sugar replacer in functional foods |
| **Tolerance threshold** | GI symptoms begin at ~5–8 g/day in sensitive individuals; well tolerated up to 4–5 g/day |

### Health Effects
- **Microbiome modulation:** Most consistent bifidogenic effect of any prebiotic; even 4 g/day for 2 weeks significantly increases *Bifidobacterium* counts
- **Immune function:** *Bifidobacterium* stimulation → increased sIgA; reduced frequency of respiratory infections in elderly (6 g/day FOS RCT)
- **Bowel function:** Softens stool, increases frequency; useful in functional constipation
- **Glycaemic index:** Low GI (≈1); blunts postprandial glucose response when used as sucrose replacer

## Pectin

### Structure and Sources
Pectin is a complex heteropolysaccharide primarily composed of **galacturonic acid** residues (α-1,4 linked), with regions of rhamnogalacturonan decorated with arabinose, galactose, and other sugars. It is found in the **cell walls and middle lamella of terrestrial plants**. Commercially extracted from apple pomace and citrus peel. Two major forms: **high-methoxyl pectin** (HM, >50% methylated, forms gels at low pH with sugar) and **low-methoxyl pectin** (LM, gels with Ca²⁺ ions, preferred for food and pharmaceutical applications).

| Property | Details |
|---|---|
| **Molecular weight** | 50,000–150,000 Da (high MW forms more viscous gels) |
| **Fermentation rate** | Moderate-to-slow; fermented throughout the colon; promotes diverse microbiota |
| **Microbiome effect** | Less strictly bifidogenic than inulin/FOS; promotes *Akkermansia muciniphila*, *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii*, *Bacteroides* spp. — associated with gut barrier integrity |
| **Viscosity** | Forms highly viscous gel in GI lumen → physical cholesterol-lowering mechanism |
| **Key sources** | Apples, citrus peel, apricot, plum, guava; apple pectin from highest DRI consideration |

### Health Effects
- **Cholesterol reduction:** ~10–15% LDL reduction with 6–15 g/day citrus/apple pectin; mechanism: bile acid sequestration (similar to cholestyramine but much weaker), reduced micellar cholesterol absorption — FDA approved "may reduce risk of heart disease" claim
- **Postprandial glycaemia:** Viscous gel slows gastric emptying → blunts glucose and insulin spikes; 10 g pectin reduces postprandial glucose by ~20% in T2DM patients
- **Satiety:** Reduces gastric emptying rate → prolonged satiety; PYY and GLP-1 secretion stimulates
- **Colon cancer:** Galacturonic acid residues and SCFA production from pectin fermentation; *in vitro* studies show pectin-derived oligomers bind and inhibit galectin-3 (metastasis promoter) — phase I/II clinical trial data emerging
- **Diarrhoea:** High-pectin apple sauce historically used for diarrhoea (BRAT diet rationale); absorbs water, adds bulk, mild antimicrobial effect

## Clinical Interactions

| Interaction | Details |
|---|---|
| **Probiotic synergy (synbiotics)** | FOS/inulin + *Bifidobacterium* or *Lactobacillus* = synbiotic → better colonisation and metabolic activity than either alone |
| **Medications (sulfonylureas, metformin)** | Prebiotic-mediated GLP-1 increase + glucose lowering → may potentiate hypoglycaemic drugs; monitor blood glucose |
| **Anticoagulants** | Pectin may slightly reduce warfarin bioavailability by viscous-gel-mediated bile sequestration; monitor INR if high-dose pectin supplementation begun |
| **FODMAP sensitivity** | FOS and inulin are high-FODMAP — contraindicated during low-FODMAP elimination phase for IBS; reintroduced in FODMAP rechallenge phase |
| **Phenolic absorption** | Pectin and inulin reduce absorption of some polyphenols in the small intestine but may increase colonic availability; net effect on antioxidant status unclear |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Inulin:** 5–15 g/day; start low (3 g/day) and titrate up over 2–3 weeks to minimise flatulence; long-chain HP inulin better tolerated and more distal than short-chain Orafti GR
- **FOS:** 4–8 g/day for bifidogenic effect; split dose across meals reduces GI symptoms; taste is mildly sweet — can replace 30–50% sugar
- **Pectin:** 6–15 g/day for cholesterol reduction; gel-forming in liquid — mix thoroughly; apple pectin supplements (450 mg capsules) provide lower doses requiring multiple servings
- **Tolerability tip:** Any fermentable fibre taken rapidly in high doses causes bloating/flatulence; always introduce gradually
- **FODMAP note:** Avoid high-dose FOS/inulin during IBS symptom management; pectin is generally better tolerated in IBS
