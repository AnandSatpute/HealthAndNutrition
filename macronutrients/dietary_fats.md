# Dietary Fats

## Overview
Dietary fats (lipids) are the most **energy-dense macronutrient** at **9 kcal per gram** — more than double carbohydrates or protein. They are essential for fat-soluble vitamin absorption (A, D, E, K), cell membrane integrity, hormone synthesis (steroid hormones, eicosanoids), thermal insulation, and organ cushioning. Fats are classified by the degree of saturation of their fatty acid chains — a fundamental determinant of their physical properties, metabolic fate, and health effects. The narrative around dietary fat has shifted dramatically: dietary fat quality (type) matters far more than total fat quantity.

- **Classification:** Macronutrient; 9 kcal/g
- **Storage form:** Triacylglycerols (TAGs) in adipose tissue — essentially unlimited energy reserve
- **Essential fats:** Linoleic acid (LA; 18:2 n-6, Omega-6) and Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3 n-3, Omega-3) are the only truly essential dietary fats — all others can be synthesised
- **Fat-soluble vitamin carrier:** Required for absorption, transport, and storage of vitamins A, D, E, and K

## Classification of Dietary Fats

| Category | Structure | Sources | Primary Health Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Saturated fatty acids (SFA)** | No double bonds; straight-chain (solid at room temp) | Butter, ghee, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, fatty meat, full-fat dairy | Raise LDL-C (primarily LDL-P); neutral to slightly positive on HDL-C; heterogeneous by chain length |
| **Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)** | One double bond (*cis*); liquid at room temp | Olive oil, avocado, nuts (hazelnuts, almonds, cashews), canola oil | Lower LDL-C; neutral or raise HDL-C; anti-inflammatory |
| **Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) — n-6** | 2+ double bonds; Omega-6 family | Sunflower, corn, soybean, safflower oils; seeds | Lower LDL-C; pro- and anti-inflammatory (LA); n-6:n-3 ratio matters |
| **Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) — n-3** | 2+ double bonds; Omega-3 family | Fatty fish (EPA/DHA), flaxseed, chia, walnuts (ALA) | Anti-inflammatory; lower TG; reduce CVD events |
| **Trans fatty acids (TFA)** | Double bonds in *trans* configuration | Partially hydrogenated oils (industrial TFA); ruminant TFA (CLA in dairy, beef) | Industrial TFA: raise LDL-C, lower HDL-C, strongly pro-inflammatory; ruminant TFA (CLA): neutral to beneficial |

## Saturated Fatty Acids — Chain-Length Differences

| Chain length | Example | Effect on lipids |
|---|---|---|
| **Short-chain (C4–C8)** | Butyric (C4), Caprylic (C8) | Minimal LDL effect; absorbed via portal vein (not chylomicron); energy use ≈ carbohydrate |
| **Medium-chain (C10–C12)** | Capric (C10), Lauric (C12) | Lauric acid raises both LDL-C and HDL-C; large component of coconut oil; raises TC:HDL ratio vs MUFA |
| **Long-chain (C14–C18)** | Myristic (C14), Palmitic (C16), Stearic (C18) | Palmitic: most LDL-raising SFA; Stearic: neutral (rapidly converted to oleic acid via SCD-1); Myristic: strongly raises LDL-C |
| **Very long-chain (>C18)** | Arachidic (C20) | Minor dietary amounts; minor LDL-raising effect |

> **Stearic acid (C18:0)** is a notable exception — it does not raise LDL-C because it is efficiently desaturated to oleic acid (18:1) via SCD-1 in the liver. Basis for interest in high-stearate dark chocolate (cocoa butter is ~34% stearate).

## Dietary Requirements

| Population | Fat Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Adults (AMDR) | **20–35% of total energy** (IOM/DRI) |
| Saturated fat | **<10% of energy** (WHO, AHA, EFSA); AHA recommends **<7%** for CV risk |
| Trans fat (industrial) | **<1% of energy** (WHO); ideally as low as possible; many countries have mandated elimination |
| Omega-6 (LA) AI | **11–12 g/day (women), 14–17 g/day (men)** |
| Omega-3 (ALA) AI | **1.1 g/day (women), 1.6 g/day (men)** |
| EPA + DHA (omega-3) | No formal RDA; **250–500 mg/day EPA+DHA** recommended by AHA, EFSA, and WHO for cardiovascular health |
| Minimum fat intake | **<20% fat** risks inadequate fat-soluble vitamin absorption; very low-fat diets not recommended |

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Digestion** | Lingual and gastric lipase initiate TAG hydrolysis; pancreatic lipase (with colipase) is the primary TAG hydrolase in the duodenum; bile salts emulsify fat → micelles → lipase access |
| **Absorption** | Free fatty acids (FFA) + monoacylglycerols + cholesterol absorbed into enterocytes; long-chain FA → re-esterified into TAG → chylomicrons → lymph (thoracic duct → subclavian vein); medium-chain FA (C8–C12) → portal vein directly |
| **Chylomicron processing** | Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) on capillary walls hydrolyses chylomicron TAG → FFA released to adipose/muscle; chylomicron remnants → liver |
| **VLDL/LDL/HDL cycle** | Liver packages TAG + cholesterol → VLDL → IDL → LDL (cholesterol-rich); LDL-R (LDL receptor) on liver/peripheral cells clears LDL; HDL participates in reverse cholesterol transport |
| **β-Oxidation** | FA activated to acyl-CoA → carnitine shuttle into mitochondria → β-oxidation → acetyl-CoA → TCA cycle; long-chain FA requires carnitine (CACT/CPT1/CPT2 system) |
| **Ketogenesis** | In fasting/low-carb: excess acetyl-CoA → HMG-CoA → β-hydroxybutyrate + acetoacetate (ketone bodies) — alternative fuel for brain, heart, skeletal muscle |
| **Steroid hormone synthesis** | Cholesterol → pregnenolone → all steroid hormones (cortisol, aldosterone, testosterone, oestrogen, progesterone, vitamin D) |
| **Eicosanoid synthesis** | AA (n-6) → COX → prostaglandins, thromboxanes (pro-inflammatory); EPA (n-3) → COX → 3-series prostaglandins (less active); DHA → resolvins, protectins (anti-inflammatory resolution) |

## Clinical Relevance

### Cardiovascular Disease
- The relationship between dietary fat and CVD is complex: **replacing SFA with PUFA** (especially n-6 LA) reduces CVD events (strong RCT evidence; PREDIMED, DELTA, Finnish Mental Hospital Study). The composition of the replacement matters — PUFA > MUFA > refined carbohydrate for CVD risk reduction when replacing SFA.
- **Trans fatty acids (industrial):** Strongest dietary predictor of CHD; raise LDL-C, lower HDL-C, increase Lp(a), increase markers of inflammation. Industrial TFA have been effectively eliminated from most food supplies (FDA GRAS status revoked 2015; WHO REPLACE initiative).
- **LDL-C vs LDL particle number (LDL-P):** SFAs primarily raise small dense LDL particles (most atherogenic); polyunsaturated fats shift LDL to larger, more buoyant particles; LDL particle number is a more powerful CVD predictor than LDL-C alone (NMR lipoprofile).

### Omega-3 and Cardiovascular Risk
- **EPA + DHA** (preformed marine omega-3s): Reduce TG by 20–50% at 2–4 g/day (approved indication for icosapentaenoic acid — Vascepa — at 4 g/day for hypertriglyceridaemia in REDUCE-IT trial: 25% reduction in MACE).
- Mechanism: Reduces VLDL synthesis, increases TG clearance via LPL, anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic, reduces platelet aggregation.
- **ALA** (plant-based omega-3): Conversion to EPA is ~5–10%; to DHA ~0–4% — insufficient to meet needs without marine sources or supplementation.

### Fat-Soluble Vitamin Malabsorption
- Dietary fat intake <20 g/day impairs absorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K; fat malabsorption (Crohn's, cystic fibrosis, cholestatic liver disease, short bowel syndrome) → clinical deficiencies of all four fat-soluble vitamins.
- Adding fat to meals with fat-soluble supplements/foods significantly improves absorption (e.g., vitamin D with a fat-containing meal doubles absorption vs. fasting).

### Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)
- **Excess fructose** (via de novo lipogenesis) and **excess saturated fat** are the primary dietary drivers of hepatic fat accumulation.
- Mediterranean diet (high MUFA/n-3, low SFA, high fibre) is the most evidence-based dietary intervention for NAFLD.
- Omega-3 supplementation reduces hepatic fat content in NAFLD (multiple RCTs) but does not consistently improve fibrosis scores.

### Gallstone Disease
- Very low-fat diets paradoxically increase gallstone risk — gallbladder requires fat stimulation (via CCK) to contract and empty; stasis → cholesterol gallstone formation.
- Moderate fat intake (especially MUFA) stimulates adequate gallbladder motility.

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)** | Dietary fat required for micelle formation and absorption; inadequate dietary fat → deficiencies even with adequate vitamin intake; fat-rich meals improve vitamin D absorption 2-fold |
| **Omega-6:Omega-3 ratio** | Western diet ratio ~15–20:1 (excess n-6); optimal estimated at 4:1 or below for anti-inflammatory balance; excess n-6 competes with n-3 for Δ6-desaturase and membrane incorporation |
| **Bile acids** | Bile (from cholesterol) essential for fat digestion; enterohepatic recycling; dietary fibre binds bile acids → excretion → increased LDL-receptor expression (LDL-C lowering) |
| **Carbohydrates (refined)** | Replacing dietary fat with refined carbohydrate raises TG, lowers HDL-C, raises small dense LDL particles — net adverse effect on lipid profile despite lowering total LDL-C |
| **Vitamin E** | Tocopherols protect PUFAs from oxidation in membranes and food; high PUFA diets increase vitamin E requirement; sunflower, safflower oils (high LA) naturally contain α-tocopherol |
| **Carnitine** | Transports long-chain FA across inner mitochondrial membrane for β-oxidation; carnitine deficiency impairs fat oxidation (clinical carnitine deficiency is rare, primarily in haemodialysis patients) |
| **Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)** | Insulin activates LPL → clears TG from circulation; LPL activity is reduced in insulin resistance → hypertriglyceridaemia; omega-3 FA and fibrates increase LPL activity |
| **Cholesterol absorption (dietary)** | Dietary cholesterol has modest effect on blood cholesterol in most people (hyperresponders: ~25% of population); phytosterols (plant sterols) competitively inhibit cholesterol absorption → lower LDL-C by 8–10% at 2 g/day |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Fish oil (EPA+DHA):** Most evidence-based omega-3 supplement; 1–4 g EPA+DHA/day; reduces TG; reduces CVD risk in high-risk patients; prescription-grade icosapentaenoic acid (Vascepa) at 4 g/day has RCT evidence for MACE reduction; common side effect: fishy burps (mitigated by enteric-coated formulas, taking with meals, freezing capsules)
- **Algal oil (DHA):** Vegan alternative, derived from the marine algae that fish consume; provides preformed DHA (~250–500 mg/serve); less EPA than fish oil; appropriate for vegans/vegetarians
- **MCT oil (medium-chain triglycerides):** C8 (caprylic) and C10 (capric) glycerides; rapidly absorbed via portal vein, do not require carnitine for mitochondrial entry; used in ketogenic diets and as an easily digested fat for malabsorption; C8 most ketogenic; GI intolerance at doses >30 g/day when titrated rapidly
- **Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA):** Ruminant-derived TFA (natural); modestly reduces body fat in RCTs (~0.09 kg/week at 3.2 g/day vs placebo — small but consistent); found naturally in dairy and beef
- **Phytosterol/stanol supplements:** 2 g/day reduces LDL-C by 8–10%; available in fortified margarines, capsules; most effective when taken with fat-containing meals; do not use in phytosterolaemia (rare genetic condition) or in children except under medical supervision
- **Krill oil:** Contains EPA+DHA in phospholipid form (potentially better bioavailability vs ethyl ester fish oil); also contains astaxanthin (antioxidant carotenoid); smaller capsule; higher cost per gram EPA+DHA vs fish oil
