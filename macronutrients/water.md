# Water

## Overview
Water is the most abundant compound in the human body, comprising **~60% of body weight** in adult men and ~55% in adult women (varies by body composition — lean tissue is ~73% water, adipose tissue ~10%). Although not a source of calories, water is universally classified as an essential nutrient: survival without it is limited to days, compared to weeks without food. Water serves as the universal biological solvent, enabling all biochemical reactions, nutrient transport, thermoregulation, joint lubrication, waste elimination, and cellular homeostasis. Hydration status profoundly affects cognitive function, physical performance, kidney function, and gut health.

- **Classification:** Essential nutrient; 0 kcal; sometimes classified as the "forgotten macronutrient"
- **Body distribution:** Intracellular fluid (ICF) ~60% of total body water (TBW); Extracellular fluid (ECF) ~40% TBW (plasma ~7.5%, interstitial fluid ~25%, transcellular fluids ~7.5%)
- **Regulatory hormones:** ADH (vasopressin), aldosterone, ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)
- **Unique property:** High heat capacity (4.18 J/g·°C) and heat of vaporisation (2,430 J/g) makes it an ideal thermoregulatory medium via sweat evaporation

## Daily Water Balance

### Inputs
| Source | Volume (approximate) |
|---|---|
| Beverages (all fluids) | 1,400–2,000 mL/day |
| Water in food | 700–1,000 mL/day |
| Metabolic water (oxidative metabolism) | 200–300 mL/day |
| **Total intake** | **~2,300–3,300 mL/day (typical sedentary adult)** |

### Outputs
| Route | Volume (approximate) |
|---|---|
| Urine | 1,000–1,500 mL/day (regulated by ADH) |
| Insensible losses — skin (diffusion) | ~350–400 mL/day |
| Sweat (active evaporation) | 0–several litres/hour (highly variable) |
| Respiratory losses | 250–350 mL/day |
| Faecal losses | 100–200 mL/day |
| **Total output** | **~2,100–2,500 mL/day (non-exercise, temperate)** |

> **Metabolic water** is produced by oxidative phosphorylation: oxidation of 100 g fat → ~107 g water; 100 g carbohydrate → ~55 g water; 100 g protein → ~41 g water. Camels exploit this (fatty hump) — but humans cannot meaningfully rely on it for hydration.

## Dietary Requirements (Adequate Intakes)

| Population | Total Water AI (all sources) |
|---|---|
| Adult men (19–50 yr) | **3.7 L/day** (IOM) |
| Adult women (19–50 yr) | **2.7 L/day** |
| Pregnancy | +0.3 L/day (3.0 L total) |
| Lactation | +0.7 L/day (3.8 L total) |
| Children 1–3 yr | 1.3 L/day |
| Children 9–13 yr (boys) | 2.4 L/day |
| Older adults (>65 yr) | Same or higher need; **impaired thirst sensation** increases dehydration risk |
| Athletes / hot climate | **Highly individual — 0.5–1.0 L sweat per hour during exercise**; replace based on body weight change |

> The "8×8 rule" (8 glasses × 8 oz = ~1.9 L/day) has no scientific basis — the IOM AIs above are evidence-based. Needs vary by body size, activity, climate, diet composition (high fruit/vegetable intake provides significant water), and health status. **Pale yellow urine** is the practical indicator of adequate hydration.

## Physiological Functions

| Function | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Universal solvent** | Water's polarity (dipole moment) enables dissolution of ionic compounds (electrolytes), polar molecules (glucose, amino acids, vitamins), and protein hydration shells — prerequisite for all biochemical reactions |
| **Thermoregulation** | Sweating: ~580 kcal removed per litre of sweat evaporated; core temp maintained within a narrow range (36.5–37.5°C); without this, core temperature would rise ~1°C per 5–8 min during moderate exercise |
| **Nutrient and oxygen transport** | Plasma (blood = 55% plasma by volume; plasma = ~92% water) carries O₂ (dissolved + haemoglobin-bound), glucose, fatty acids, amino acids, hormones, immune cells, vitamins |
| **Waste elimination** | Kidneys filter ~180 L plasma/day → excrete ~1–2 L urine containing urea, creatinine, uric acid, drug metabolites; minimum urine output ~500 mL/day to excrete daily solute load |
| **Digestion and absorption** | Saliva (~1.5 L/day), gastric juice (~2 L/day), pancreatic secretions (~1.5 L/day), bile (~1 L/day), intestinal secretions (~1 L/day) — ~7 L secreted into GI tract daily, almost entirely reabsorbed |
| **Lubricant and cushion** | Synovial fluid (joint lubrication — predominantly water + hyaluronan); cerebrospinal fluid (cushions brain/spinal cord); pleural, pericardial, amniotic fluids |
| **Cellular volume regulation** | Osmotic pressure drives water between ICF and ECF; AQP (aquaporins — water channels) regulate trans-membrane water movement; cell swelling/shrinkage alters enzyme activity and gene expression |
| **Hydrolysis reactions** | Water is a reactant in hydrolytic cleavage of peptide bonds, ester bonds, glycosidic bonds — fundamental to digestion and many metabolic pathways |
| **Acid-base equilibrium** | Water acts as both acid (donates H⁺) and base (accepts H⁺); H₂CO₃/HCO₃⁻ buffering system (Henderson-Hasselbalch); maintains blood pH 7.35–7.45 |

## Electrolyte Balance and Osmolality

| Electrolyte | Compartment | Normal Serum Range | Key Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sodium (Na⁺)** | ECF dominant | 135–145 mEq/L | Principal ECF osmole; determines plasma osmolality; regulated by ADH and aldosterone |
| **Potassium (K⁺)** | ICF dominant | 3.5–5.0 mEq/L | Resting membrane potential, action potentials, cardiac rhythm |
| **Chloride (Cl⁻)** | ECF | 98–106 mEq/L | Charge balance for Na⁺; HCl production in stomach |
| **Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻)** | ECF | 22–29 mEq/L | Primary blood buffer |
| **Calcium (Ca²⁺)** | ECF (ionised) | 1.1–1.4 mmol/L | Neuromuscular excitability, cardiac function, clotting |
| **Magnesium (Mg²⁺)** | ICF | 0.7–1.0 mmol/L | Enzyme cofactor; cardiac and neuromuscular stability |

**Plasma osmolality** = 2×[Na⁺] + [Glucose]/18 + [BUN]/2.8 ≈ 285–295 mOsm/kg
- **ADH** released when osmolality rises >290 or volume drops >10% → renal water retention → dilutes osmolality
- **Aldosterone** released (via RAAS) when Na⁺ low or volume low → renal Na⁺ retention → water follows osmotically

## Dehydration

| Level | % Body Weight Lost as Water | Signs and Symptoms |
|---|---|---|
| Mild | 1–2% | Thirst, slight reduction in cognitive performance, ~10% decrease in aerobic capacity |
| Moderate | 3–5% | Headache, dry mouth, reduced urine output, irritability, impaired attention, ≥20% aerobic capacity decrease |
| Severe | 6–8% | Muscle cramps, rapid heart rate, dizziness, confusion, oliguria |
| Critical | >10% | Delirium, organ failure, death if untreated |

> **Thirst lags dehydration by 1–2%** — by the time you feel thirsty, performance is already mildly impaired. Athletes and older adults should drink proactively, not reactively. However, **drinking to thirst** is appropriate for most sedentary people and for preventing overhydration.

## Overhydration and Hyponatraemia

| Condition | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **Exercise-associated hyponatraemia (EAH)** | Excess hypotonic fluid intake (outpaces renal excretion) + ADH non-suppression during exercise dilutes plasma Na⁺ | Can occur in slow endurance athletes overdrinking plain water; prevents by drinking to thirst or using electrolyte drinks; Na⁺ <135 mEq/L → cerebral oedema → seizures (severe) |
| **Psychogenic polydipsia** | Compulsive water drinking (often in psychiatric illness); >1 L/hour overwhelms renal max clearance (~0.8–1 L/hour) | Chronic dilutional hyponatraemia |
| **SIADH** | Inappropriate ADH secretion → excessive renal water retention → dilutional hyponatraemia | Caused by CNS disease, pulmonary disease, drugs (SSRIs, carbamazepine, cyclophosphamide, NSAIDs) |

## Clinical Relevance

### Kidney Stones
- Adequate hydration is the **most effective preventive measure** for all kidney stone types; target urine output >2 L/day (requires total fluid intake ~2.5–3 L/day).
- Dilute urine reduces calcium oxalate, uric acid, and calcium phosphate supersaturation.
- **Lemon juice** (citric acid → urinary citrate) is specifically beneficial for calcium oxalate stones (citrate chelates calcium, inhibits crystallisation).

### Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)
- Increased water intake (1.5 additional litres/day over baseline) reduces UTI recurrence by ~50% in women with recurrent UTIs (JAMA 2018 RCT).
- Mechanism: More frequent urination flushes bacteria from the urethra.

### Constipation
- Adequate fluid intake combined with dietary fibre is required for fibre to have its stool-bulking effect; fibre without water can worsen constipation.
- Carbonated water marginally superior to still water for constipation relief in some trials.

### Cognitive Function and Mood
- Dehydration of 1–2% body weight impairs attention, working memory, and psychomotor speed — particularly in the elderly and in heat; relevant for academic performance and occupational safety.
- Headache is a common symptom of mild dehydration.

### Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Management
- In **heart failure**, free water may need restriction (<1.5 L/day) to prevent volume overload and dilutional hyponatraemia.
- In **CKD**, fluid management is individualised — early CKD benefits from high fluid intake (reduces progression); advanced CKD or anuria requires restriction.

## Interactions

| Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Sodium** | Na⁺ is the primary osmotic determinant of ECF volume; high sodium intake proportionally increases water requirement and retention; WHO recommends <5 g NaCl/day |
| **Caffeine** | Mild diuretic effect at high doses (>250 mg/day); at habitual intake levels, coffee and tea contribute to net hydration (the diuresis is less than the fluid delivered); tolerance develops rapidly |
| **Alcohol** | Suppresses ADH release → diuresis → net dehydration effect; drinks above ~4% ABV cause net fluid loss; explains post-alcohol dehydration/headache (exacerbated by vasodilation) |
| **Dietary fibre** | Soluble fibre absorbs water in the gut → requires adequate water intake to maintain GI motility; insoluble fibre absorbs water → stool bulking; fibre + inadequate water → constipation |
| **Protein (high intake)** | Increases renal urea load → obligatory water needed for urea excretion; high-protein diets may slightly increase water requirement (~0.5–1 mL/kcal from protein = ~300–500 mL extra/day) |
| **Exercise / heat** | Sweat losses highly variable: 0.5–2.5 L/hour depending on intensity, heat, humidity, acclimatisation state; sodium losses 0.5–2 g/L sweat; electrolyte replacement essential during prolonged exercise (>1 hour) |
| **ADH / vasopressin** | Antidiuretic hormone is the central bottleneck of water regulation; many drugs and conditions impair ADH regulation (lithium causes nephrogenic DI; SSRI → SIADH) |
| **Diuretics** | Loop diuretics (furosemide), thiazides, acetazolamide — all increase urinary water and electrolyte losses; careful monitoring of hydration and electrolytes required |

## Practical and Supplementation Notes
- **Plain water** remains the optimal hydration beverage for most people; no supplement is needed for routine sedentary hydration
- **Electrolyte drinks / oral rehydration salts (ORS):** WHO ORS formula for diarrhoeal dehydration: 75 mEq/L Na⁺, 75 mmol/L glucose, 20 mEq/L K⁺ — isotonicity drives active co-transport absorption via SGLT1; superior to plain water for rehydration in significant diarrhoea/vomiting
- **Sports drinks (isotonic, 6% CHO + electrolytes):** Evidence-based for endurance exercise >60–90 min; replenish glycogen + sodium + fluid simultaneously; unnecessary for <60 min exercise or casual activity
- **IV fluids (clinical use):** Normal saline (0.9% NaCl), Lactated Ringer's, Hartmann's solution for volume resuscitation; 5% dextrose for hypoglycaemia/energy; choice depends on clinical context
- **Coconut water:** Natural hypotonic beverage; moderate K⁺, low Na⁺; insufficient Na⁺ for prolonged exercise rehydration (add a pinch of salt); suitable casual hydration alternative
- **Hydration monitoring:** Urine colour (pale yellow = adequate; dark yellow = dehydrated; clear = possibly over-hydrated); urine specific gravity 1.010–1.025 (adequate range); body weight pre/post exercise (1 kg loss ≈ ~1 L fluid deficit)
- **Carbonated water:** Safe; does not damage tooth enamel with normal consumption (very low carbonic acid concentration); some evidence of slight constipation benefit; may increase satiety marginally; does not impair hydration
- **Hydrogen-rich water:** No credible clinical evidence of benefit beyond ordinary water; classified as a dubious wellness product
