# Carbohydrates

## Overview
Carbohydrates are the body's **primary and most readily available energy source**, providing 4 kcal per gram. They are organic compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (CH₂O)ₙ, synthesised by plants through photosynthesis and consumed as starches, sugars, and non-digestible fibres. The brain is almost entirely dependent on glucose derived from carbohydrates, consuming ~120 g/day at rest. Carbohydrates drive metabolic processes, spare protein from catabolism, regulate fat metabolism, and serve as the substrate for glycogen synthesis in liver and muscle.

- **Classification:** Macronutrient; 4 kcal/g
- **Storage form:** Glycogen (liver ~100 g, muscle ~400 g)
- **Primary fuel for:** Brain, red blood cells (obligate glucose users), renal medulla, exercising muscle
- **Key property:** Only macronutrient that can fuel anaerobic (glycolytic) metabolism; fastest ATP production rate of the three macronutrients

## Classification of Carbohydrates

| Category | Examples | Digestibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Monosaccharides** | Glucose, Fructose, Galactose | Immediate absorption |
| **Disaccharides** | Sucrose (glu+fru), Lactose (glu+gal), Maltose (glu+glu) | Digested at brush border |
| **Oligosaccharides** | FOS, GOS, Raffinose | Mostly fermented (prebiotic) |
| **Polysaccharides — starchy** | Amylose, Amylopectin, Glycogen | Digested by amylases |
| **Polysaccharides — non-starchy (fibre)** | Cellulose, Pectin, Inulin, Beta-glucan | Not digested; fermented or excreted |

## Dietary Requirements

| Population | Recommended Carbohydrate Intake |
|---|---|
| Adults (general) | **130 g/day** (EAR; minimum to sustain brain glucose needs without gluconeogenesis) |
| Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) | **45–65% of total energy intake** (DRI, IOM) |
| Athletes (moderate exercise) | 5–7 g/kg/day |
| Athletes (high-intensity/endurance) | 6–10 g/kg/day |
| Dietary fibre (adults) | **AI: 25 g/day (women), 38 g/day (men)**; most adults consume <15 g/day |

> No established UL for carbohydrates, but excess added sugar intake is associated with obesity, dyslipidaemia (hypertriglyceridaemia), dental caries, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). WHO recommends **free sugars <10% of energy** (ideally <5%).

## Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load

| Concept | Definition | Range |
|---|---|---|
| **Glycemic Index (GI)** | Rate at which 50 g available carbohydrate raises blood glucose relative to pure glucose (GI=100) | Low: <55, Medium: 55–69, High: ≥70 |
| **Glycemic Load (GL)** | GI × (carbohydrate content per serving ÷ 100); accounts for portion size | Low: <10, Medium: 11–19, High: ≥20 |

> **GL is more clinically meaningful than GI**: A watermelon has a high GI (~72) but a low GL (~4 per typical serving) because a standard portion has little actual carbohydrate. White rice: GI ~72, GL ~29 per cup — a high-GL food.

**Factors that lower GI:**
- Presence of fat, protein, or fibre (slows gastric emptying)
- Intact grain structure (whole grains vs. flour)
- Acidity (vinegar, sourdough fermentation)
- Resistant starch (cooked-and-cooled potato/rice)
- Al dente cooking (less gelatinised starch = slower digestion)

## Dietary Fibre

| Type | Examples | Primary Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Soluble fibre** | Pectin, beta-glucan, inulin, psyllium | Viscous gel formation → slows glucose absorption → lowers LDL-C; fermented by gut microbiota → SCFAs |
| **Insoluble fibre** | Cellulose, wheat bran, lignin | Increases stool bulk; accelerates colonic transit; reduces colorectal cancer risk |
| **Resistant starch (RS)** | Cooked-and-cooled potato/rice, unripe banana, legumes | Behaves as prebiotic fibre; produces butyrate → colonocyte fuel |

**Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) from fibre fermentation:**
- **Butyrate**: Primary fuel for colonocytes; anti-inflammatory; may protect against colorectal cancer
- **Propionate**: Hepatic gluconeogenesis substrate; reduces hepatic lipogenesis
- **Acetate**: Systemic energy substrate; may suppress appetite via GPR43

## Metabolism

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Digestion** | Salivary and pancreatic α-amylase hydrolyse starch → maltose, maltotriose; brush-border enzymes (maltase, sucrase, lactase) hydrolyse disaccharides → monosaccharides |
| **Absorption** | Glucose and galactose: SGLT1 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 1, active); Fructose: GLUT5 (passive facilitated diffusion); all exit basolateral side via GLUT2 → portal vein |
| **Hepatic processing** | Fructose → fructose-1-phosphate → trioses (DHAP, glyceraldehyde) → glycolysis/de novo lipogenesis/gluconeogenesis; Galactose → galactose-1-phosphate → UDP-galactose → glycogen |
| **Glycolysis** | Glucose → 2× pyruvate; net yield 2 ATP (anaerobic) or entry into TCA cycle via acetyl-CoA → 30–32 ATP (aerobic) |
| **Glycogen synthesis** | Liver: glucose → glycogen (glycogenesis); regulated by insulin (activates glycogen synthase); Muscle: stores glycogen exclusively for local use |
| **Glycogen breakdown** | Glucagon, epinephrine → glycogenolysis → glucose-1-phosphate → glucose-6-phosphate (muscle cannot release free glucose; liver can via glucose-6-phosphatase) |
| **Gluconeogenesis** | When glycogen depleted: liver/kidney synthesise glucose from lactate, alanine, glycerol — preserves brain glucose during fasting |

## Clinical Relevance

### Diabetes and Glycaemic Control
- In **type 2 diabetes**, impaired insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation in muscle and adipose tissue leads to hyperglycaemia. Dietary carbohydrate type and amount are primary modulators of postprandial glucose.
- **Low-carbohydrate diets** (<26% energy from CHO) consistently reduce HbA1c in T2DM; very low-carbohydrate (ketogenic, <50 g/day) diets can achieve near-normal glycaemia but require careful medication adjustment.
- **Fructose overconsumption:** High fructose intake (especially from HFCS in SSBs) bypasses PFK-1 regulation → unregulated hepatic lipogenesis → hypertriglyceridaemia, hepatic steatosis (NAFLD), hyperuricaemia.

### Metabolic Syndrome
- Excess refined carbohydrate intake raises postprandial insulin → promotes fat storage, suppresses lipolysis → central adiposity, insulin resistance cycle.
- High-carbohydrate, low-fat diets consistently raise triglycerides and lower HDL-C (particularly when refined CHO replaces dietary fat).

### Cardiovascular Disease
- **Soluble fibre (beta-glucan, psyllium):** Binds bile acids → increases hepatic LDL-receptor expression → lowers LDL-C. **3 g/day oat beta-glucan** is sufficient for a clinically significant LDL-C reduction (~5–10%).
- Whole grain consumption is associated with reduced CVD risk in epidemiological studies.

### Athletic Performance
- **Glycogen depletion** (after ~90–120 min high-intensity exercise) causes fatigue; carbohydrate loading pre-race (supercompensation) maximises glycogen stores.
- **Intra-exercise carbohydrate** (30–60 g/hour): glucose+fructose mixture at a 2:1 ratio uses both SGLT1 and GLUT5 transporters → total intestinal absorption up to 90 g/hour vs 60 g/hour with glucose alone.

### Lactose Intolerance
- Deficiency of brush-border **lactase** → undigested lactose reaches colon → fermentation → gas (H₂, CO₂, CH₄), bloating, diarrhoea. Prevalence: ~65–70% of adults globally; highest in East Asian, West African, and Middle Eastern populations.

## Interactions

| Nutrient / Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Insulin** | Carbohydrate (especially high-GI) is the primary insulin secretagogue; glycaemic index, fibre content, and portion size all modulate insulin response |
| **Dietary fat** | Fat slows gastric emptying → blunts postprandial glucose and insulin peaks; fat + CHO combination lowers the GI of the overall meal |
| **Protein** | Protein independently stimulates insulin secretion (particularly leucine, BCAAs); protein + CHO at a meal → greater insulin response than CHO alone (useful post-exercise for glycogen resynthesis) |
| **Dietary fibre** | Soluble fibre: lowers glycaemic response of co-ingested carbohydrates; insoluble fibre: negligible effect on glycaemic response |
| **Chromium** | Chromium potentiates insulin signalling (component of chromodulin); deficiency impairs glucose tolerance |
| **Magnesium** | Required for all phosphate-transfer reactions in glycolysis and glycogen synthesis; magnesium deficiency is associated with insulin resistance |
| **Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)** | Rate-limiting cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase (pyruvate → acetyl-CoA) and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; thiamine deficiency blocks aerobic carbohydrate metabolism → lactic acidosis |
| **Resistant starch (cooled)** | Retrograded (resistant) starch increases after cooking and cooling — lower glycaemic response than freshly cooked starch; enhances colonic fermentation and SCFA production |

## Supplementation / Practical Notes
- **No supplement needed for most people** — dietary carbohydrates are universally available; focus should be on food quality (whole grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables) rather than supplementation
- **Sports carbohydrate supplements:** Glucose polymers (maltodextrin) + fructose gels/drinks during endurance events; rapid gastric emptying; useful when solid food is impractical
- **Psyllium husk (5–10 g/day with water):** Evidence-based soluble fibre supplement for LDL-C reduction and glycaemic improvement; start low to avoid flatulence
- **Inulin/FOS (3–8 g/day):** Prebiotic fibre supplement for gut microbiome support; excessive doses cause GI discomfort
- **Resistant starch (raw potato/banana starch):** Emerging interest as prebioitc; 15–30 g/day studied for SCFA-mediated gut health benefits; tolerance varies
- **Very low carbohydrate / ketogenic diets:** Below ~50 g/day, hepatic ketogenesis produces ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate) → brain adapts over 3–4 weeks to ketone oxidation; reduces need for gluconeogenesis; medical supervision warranted for T2DM patients on insulin/sulfonylureas
