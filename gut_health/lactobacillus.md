# Lactobacillus (Probiotic Genus)

## Overview
*Lactobacillus* is a genus of Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria that produce lactic acid as their primary fermentation end-product. They are among the most clinically studied and commercially used probiotics. Historically a single large genus, *Lactobacillus* was reclassified in 2020 into 23 genera; many familiar species now belong to renamed genera (e.g., *Lactiplantibacillus plantarum*, *Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus*), though the old names remain in widespread use. *Lactobacillus* species are naturally found in the human gastrointestinal tract, vagina, and oral cavity, and are major components of fermented foods.

- **Classification:** Firmicutes → Bacilli → Lactobacillales → Lactobacillaceae
- **Key species:** *L. acidophilus*, *L. rhamnosus* GG (LGG), *L. plantarum*, *L. casei*, *L. reuteri*, *L. fermentum*, *L. helveticus*, *L. brevis*
- **Natural habitats:** Small intestine (especially *L. acidophilus*), colon, vagina, oral cavity, fermented foods
- **GRAS / QPS status:** Generally Recognized As Safe (FDA) / Qualified Presumption of Safety (EFSA) for most food-grade strains

## Mechanisms of Action

| Mechanism | Details |
|---|---|
| **Competitive exclusion** | Adhere to intestinal epithelium via surface proteins (S-layer, pili, mucus-binding proteins) → occupy receptor sites → prevent pathogen colonisation |
| **Lactic acid production** | Lower intestinal pH → inhibits acid-sensitive pathogens (*Salmonella*, *Clostridium*, *E. coli*) → creates selective environment for commensal bacteria |
| **Bacteriocin production** | Produce narrow-spectrum antimicrobial peptides (nisin, lactacin, reuterin) targeting closely related Gram-positive pathogens |
| **Short-chain fatty acid production** | Ferment dietary fibre → acetate, propionate, butyrate → local colonocyte fuel, anti-inflammatory signalling, gut barrier maintenance |
| **Epithelial barrier reinforcement** | Upregulate tight junction proteins (claudin-1, occludin, ZO-1) → reduce paracellular permeability ("leaky gut") |
| **Immune modulation** | Interact with Toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4) on dendritic cells and macrophages → shift Th1/Th2 balance; strain-specific regulatory T-cell induction (LGG → IL-10, TGF-β) |
| **Mucin stimulation** | Upregulate MUC2 and MUC3 gene expression → thickened mucus layer → additional pathogen exclusion barrier |

## Key Strains and Evidence Base

| Strain | Key Indications | Evidence Level |
|---|---|---|
| ***L. rhamnosus* GG (LGG)** | Acute diarrhoea, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD), rotavirus diarrhoea in children, *C. difficile* prevention | **Strong** — multiple RCTs, meta-analyses; NNT ~7 for AAD |
| ***L. acidophilus* NCFM** | Lactose intolerance (produces β-galactosidase), IBS-D, vaginal microbiome support | **Moderate** |
| ***L. plantarum* 299v** | IBS (bloating, flatulence, pain), post-antibiotic gut restoration | **Moderate** — several RCTs |
| ***L. reuteri* DSM 17938** | Infant colic (significant reduction in crying time), *H. pylori* eradication adjunct, bone density (produces reuterin) | **Moderate–Strong** |
| ***L. casei* Shirota** | Traveller's diarrhoea prevention, immune function in elderly | **Moderate** |
| ***L. helveticus* R0052** | Anxiety and mood (combined with *B. longum* R0175), bone mineral density | **Emerging** |

## Dietary Sources

| Source | Notable Strains/Notes |
|---|---|
| **Yogurt** | *L. bulgaricus*, *L. acidophilus*, *L. casei* (added cultures); labelled "live and active cultures" if ≥10⁷ CFU/g |
| **Kefir** | Diverse cocktail including multiple *Lactobacillus* spp. + yeasts; higher probiotic density than yogurt |
| **Sauerkraut** | *L. plantarum*, *L. brevis*, *L. fermenti*; heat-treatment destroys bacteria — choose unpasteurised |
| **Kimchi** | *L. kimchii*, *L. plantarum*, *L. brevis*; rich probiotic diversity |
| **Miso** | *L. acidophilus*, *L. casei* (lactic acid fermentation); note high sodium |
| **Tempeh** | Fermented soy; primarily *Rhizopus* mold but may contain lactobacilli |
| **Sourdough bread** | *L. sourdoughii*, *L. sanfranciscensis*; baking kills bacteria — benefit is from metabolites (organic acids, pre-digested gluten) |

## Clinical Relevance

### Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhoea (AAD)
- Meta-analyses (Cochrane 2019): Lactobacilli (especially LGG and *L. acidophilus*) reduce AAD risk by ~60%; NNT ≈ 7
- Best started concurrently with antibiotic course; take 2 hours apart from antibiotic dose
- Evidence strongest in children; also significant in adults

### *Clostridioides difficile* Infection (CDI)
- LGG and *L. casei* reduce primary CDI risk; insufficient evidence for recurrent CDI treatment
- Not a replacement for vancomycin/fidaxomicin; used as adjunct

### Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
- Effect is strain-specific; *L. plantarum* 299v and LGG have the most RCT support
- Global symptom improvement, particularly bloating and flatulence; effects modest vs. placebo

### Vaginal Health
- *L. crispatus*, *L. jensenii*, *L. gasseri* dominate a healthy vaginal microbiome (Lactobacillus-dominated CST I, II, III)
- Depletion associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV); oral and vaginal *L. rhamnosus* GR-1 + *L. reuteri* RC-14 reduce BV recurrence

### Infant Health
- *L. reuteri* DSM 17938 reduces crying time in colic by ~1 hour/day (Cochrane meta-analysis)
- LGG reduces incidence of atopic eczema when given to mothers in late pregnancy (NEJM 2001 and replication studies)

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Antibiotics** | Most antibiotics can kill *Lactobacillus* strains; separate dosing by 2 hours (take probiotic mid-meal interval); resume full course after antibiotic completion |
| **Prebiotic fibres (FOS, inulin)** | Selectively stimulate *Lactobacillus* growth (synbiotic effect) → enhanced colonisation and metabolic activity |
| **Immunosuppressive drugs** | Exercise caution in severely immunocompromised patients (transplant, high-dose steroids, haematological malignancy) — rare risk of bacteraemia |
| **Acid-suppressing drugs (PPIs)** | Higher gastric pH may improve *Lactobacillus* survival through stomach transit |
| **Dietary fat** | High saturated fat diet reduces *Lactobacillus* abundance; Mediterranean diet supports it |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Dose:** Most clinical trials use **10⁸–10¹⁰ CFU/day** (1–10 billion CFU); higher is not necessarily better — strain-specificity matters more than dose
- **Viability:** Check for "live and active cultures at time of consumption" labelling — not just manufacture date
- **Refrigeration:** Many *Lactobacillus* supplements require refrigeration; some microencapsulated formulations are shelf-stable
- **Duration:** Benefits are typically transient — colonisation is not permanent; continuous use required for sustained effects
- **Strain specificity:** Do not extrapolate findings from LGG to other *Lactobacillus* products; effects are strain- and dose-specific
- **Safety:** Extremely safe in healthy individuals; rare adverse events (bacteraemia) confined to critically ill or severely immunocompromised patients
