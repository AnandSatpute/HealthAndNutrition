# Bifidobacterium (Probiotic Genus)

## Overview
*Bifidobacterium* is a genus of Gram-positive, anaerobic, branched rod-shaped bacteria that are among the most abundant and clinically important members of the human gut microbiome. They are the dominant bacteria in the gut of breast-fed infants (comprising up to 90% of the colonic microbiome), where they play critical roles in immune education, colonisation resistance, and metabolism of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Abundance declines with age, antibiotic use, and Western diet. *Bifidobacterium* ferments complex polysaccharides via the "bifid shunt" (fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase pathway), producing acetate and lactate without gas production — unlike many other fermenters.

- **Classification:** Actinobacteria → Actinomycetales → Bifidobacteriaceae
- **Key species:** *B. longum*, *B. breve*, *B. infantis*, *B. bifidum*, *B. adolescentis*, *B. animalis* subsp. *lactis* (DN-173 010, BB-12)
- **Natural habitats:** Large intestine (primary residence), breast milk (unique source for neonates), vagina
- **Unique metabolism:** Bifid shunt produces 3 mol acetate + 2 mol lactate per mol glucose — highly efficient, no CO₂/H₂ gas production

## Mechanisms of Action

| Mechanism | Details |
|---|---|
| **HMO / prebiotic fermentation** | *B. infantis* and *B. longum* encode glycoside hydrolase gene clusters for HMO degradation → acetate production → colonic acidification → colonisation resistance against pathogens |
| **Acetate production** | Acetate is the primary SCFA produced; crosses blood-brain barrier; protects against enteropathogenic *E. coli* O157:H7 by upregulating intestinal epithelial cell defence genes |
| **IgA stimulation** | *Bifidobacterium* uniquely enhances secretory IgA production → first-line mucosal immune defence; critical for neonatal immune education |
| **Regulatory T-cell induction** | Certain strains (*B. infantis* 35624) induce Tregs and IL-10 production → systemic anti-inflammatory effect |
| **Tight junction upregulation** | Increase claudin-1, occludin → reduce intestinal permeability; *B. longum* BB536 reduces LPS translocation |
| **Tryptophan metabolism** | *B. longum* produces indole-3-aldehyde and indole-3-lactic acid from tryptophan → AhR activation → mucosal homeostasis; serotonin precursor pathway |
| **GABA synthesis** | *B. longum* 1714 produces GABA → implicated in gut-brain axis effects on anxiety and stress |

## Key Strains and Evidence Base

| Strain | Key Indications | Evidence Level |
|---|---|---|
| ***B. infantis* 35624 (Align)** | IBS (all subtypes — pain, bloating, bowel habits), normalises IL-10/IL-12 ratio | **Strong** — multiple RCTs vs. placebo |
| ***B. animalis* subsp. *lactis* DN-173 010** | Constipation (transit time), IBS-C; found in Activia yogurt | **Strong** for transit time |
| ***B. animalis* subsp. *lactis* BB-12** | Infant diarrhoea, AAD, immune function, vaginal health | **Moderate–Strong** |
| ***B. longum* BB536** | Seasonal allergies (pollen), IBS, upper respiratory infections | **Moderate** |
| ***B. longum* 1714** | Stress, anxiety, sleep quality (psychobiotic) | **Emerging** — phase II RCT |
| ***B. breve* M-16V** | Preterm infant gut colonisation, NEC prevention | **Moderate** |
| ***B. longum* + *L. helveticus* R0175* + R0052** | Depression and anxiety scores (HADS) — "psychobiotic" combination | **Emerging** |

## Dietary Sources

| Source | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Yogurt with specific strains** | *B. animalis* subsp. *lactis* (Activia), *B. longum* (various labelled products); check strain labelling |
| **Kefir** | Multiple *Bifidobacterium* spp. present alongside *Lactobacillus*; fermentation varies by culture |
| **Breast milk** | Not a dietary source per se, but the primary natural vehicle for *B. infantis* EVC001 to neonates |
| **Cheese (soft fermented)** | Some aged cheeses contain viable *Bifidobacterium* if not heat-treated |
| **Supplements** | Most reliable source for therapeutic doses; single-strain or combination products widely available |

> **Note:** Bifidobacteria are strict anaerobes — they are more sensitive to oxygen and stomach acid than *Lactobacillus*; encapsulation technology significantly affects viability.

## Clinical Relevance

### Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
- *B. infantis* 35624 (Align): Landmark RCT (Whorwell et al., 2006) showed significant improvement in composite IBS symptoms vs. placebo at 10⁸ dose; effect on pain, bloating, bowel habit normalisation
- Mechanism: normalises the IL-10/IL-12 ratio (immune dysregulation marker in IBS)

### Infant Health and NEC Prevention
- Dominant gut bacterium in breast-fed infants; formula-fed infants have substantially less *Bifidobacterium*, with consequences for immune development
- *B. breve* and *B. infantis* reduce the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants — one of the strongest probiotic evidence bases (Cochrane review)

### Allergic Disease and Atopy
- *B. longum* BB536 (2 × 10⁹ CFU/day): reduces nasal symptoms and medication use in Japanese cedar pollinosis (hay fever) — RCT evidence
- Colonisation with *Bifidobacterium* in early infancy (first month of life) associated with lower risk of atopic eczema and food allergy at 2 years

### Psychobiotic Evidence (Gut-Brain Axis)
- *B. longum* 1714: reduced cortisol and self-reported stress in healthy adults (NutraMed trial)
- Produces GABA and modulates HPA axis response; vagal nerve signalling implicated

### Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhoea
- *B. animalis* BB-12 in combination with LGG reduces AAD risk significantly in children

## Interactions

| Factor | Interaction |
|---|---|
| **Antibiotics** | Highly susceptible to most antibiotics — *Bifidobacterium* populations collapse during broad-spectrum antibiotic courses; supplementation during and after helps restore populations |
| **Prebiotic fibres (inulin, FOS, lactulose, GOS)** | Selectively fermented by *Bifidobacterium* → bifidogenic effect; key prebiotic partnership |
| **Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs)** | *B. infantis* is uniquely adapted to metabolise HMOs via dedicated transport and enzyme systems — explains breast-fed infant gut dominance |
| **High animal protein diet** | Reduces *Bifidobacterium* abundance; high dietary fibre from plant foods restores it |
| **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)** | May increase survival of orally ingested bifidobacteria through stomach (reduced acid kill) |
| **Immunosuppressants** | Caution in severely immunocompromised (risk of bacterial translocation, though extremely rare) |

## Supplementation Notes
- **Dose:** Clinical trials use **10⁸–10¹⁰ CFU/day**; *B. infantis* 35624 shows effect at 10⁸ CFU (Align dose); higher doses are not necessarily more effective
- **Stability:** Obligate anaerobes — more oxygen-sensitive than *Lactobacillus*; microencapsulation or nitrogen-flushed packaging important; refrigeration generally required
- **Strain specificity:** *B. infantis* ≠ *B. longum* ≠ *B. animalis*; clinical indications are strain-specific; generic "bifidobacterium" labelling is inadequate for therapeutic use
- **Synbiotic pairing:** Prebiotic fibres (FOS, GOS, inulin) significantly enhance *Bifidobacterium* activity — combination products (synbiotics) show improved outcomes vs. probiotic alone in several trials
- **Colonisation:** Like *Lactobacillus*, *Bifidobacterium* supplementation does not lead to permanent colonisation in most adults; ongoing supplementation or prebiotic support required
- **Neonatal use:** *B. infantis* EVC001 with lactoferrin in breast milk supplementation protocol has shown near-complete restoration of healthy infant microbiome composition in formula-fed neonates
